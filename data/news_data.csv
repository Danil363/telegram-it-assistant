At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings. The company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead. Designed for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?” Image Credits:Google Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more. Image Credits:Google Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google. Image Credits:Google Image Credits:Google However, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice. Now, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option. Image Credits:Google Google says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection. Not all languages, countries, or devices will be supported at launch, and users must also have a Google account to access the Gemini for TV experience.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:42:59.284711

The South Korean company first launched the Wallpaper line in 2017, and is now bringing it back with this model, dubbed OLED evo W6. The company says you can connect the TV to its Zero Connect Box wirelessly to stream lossless 4K video and audio, provided the box is within 10 meters of the TV. LG claims the TV improves on brightness, color and blacks compared to its predecessor, and is certified “reflection-free” by product testing group Intertek. The display has a refresh rate maxing out at 165Hz, and supports AMD’s FreeSync Premium tech. LG didn’t provide any pricing details, but it said that the W6 will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:13:11 +0000",2026-01-05 14:42:59.721040

The company, which entered the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in late December, said in an emergency filing over the weekend that it has been trying to reclaim company-owned devices from Russell since his resignation in May. While it has recovered six computers, Luminar is still seeking Russell’s company-issued phone and a digital copy of his personal phone. Luminar’s lawyers also wrote in the filing that Russell and his own personal employees repeatedly misled legal representatives about the founder’s location over the holidays. They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further. In emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected. “The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement. The emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already-reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc., and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division. Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW Lawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative. On November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.” One month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will & Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone. The lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead. Russell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show. “I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. Representatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.” Russell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.” Luminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence. “Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:10:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:00.194361

The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.” The sensor will start shipping until 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects the Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles. Teradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively-unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks. It’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers. Teradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, as the automakers backed away from the tech. Those deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025. Other U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (acquired and merged with rival Velodyne after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.

The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit. Lidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable. Teradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity. “Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:00.835941

The collaboration was announced at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it could help Kodiak bring its self-driving tech to more trucks, faster. Kodiak, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, has already developed and designed a self-driving system with redundant systems for braking, steering, sensors, and computers. In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began making driverless deliveries for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. Kodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas. Now, the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses. Bosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette. “We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.

The acquisition brings together two of Africa’s leading fintech infrastructure companies. Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers. Mono has raised about $17.5 million from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received from Flutterwave. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received. Founded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity. The company addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness. According to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW For Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack. Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.” Hassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving. “If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.” Against that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place. “This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said. The transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale. Both Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in Flutterwave’s Series C and Mono’s Series A) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years. That collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years. When Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following Okra’s shutdown and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to raise significantly more capital. Addressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to Pitchbook, raised $15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment. Still, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 08:55:28 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:01.634230

The chatbot, built by Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI and featured on his social media platform X, posted an apology to its account earlier this week, writing, “I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt.” The statement continued, “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on [child sexual abuse material]. It was a failure in safeguards, and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.” It’s not clear who is actually apologizing or accepting responsibility in the statement above. Defector’s Albert Burneko noted that Grok is “not in any real sense anything like an ‘I’,” which in his view makes the apology “utterly without substance” as “Grok cannot be held accountable in any meaningful way for having turned Twitter into an on-demand CSAM factory.” Futurism found that in addition to generating nonconsensual pornographic images, Grok has also been used to generate images of women being assaulted and sexually abused. “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk posted on Saturday. Some governments have taken notice, with India’s IT ministry issuing an order on Friday saying that X must take action to restrict Grok from generating content that is “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order said that X must respond within 72 hours or risk losing the “safe harbor” protections that shield it from legal liability for user-generated content.

Plus, during the recording, you can tap the button to highlight a certain point — just like you can do on the newly launched Plaud Note Pro. One nice thing about the $179 Plaud NotePin S is that you get a clip, a lanyard, a magnetic pin, and a wristband in the package. That means you can wear the device however you like. The company is also adding Apple Find My support for the pin, so that you can easily look for the device if you can’t find it. The core specifications of the device remain the same from the previous generation. There is 64GB of onboard storage with a battery capacity of 20 hours of continuous recording. The device has two MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics that can capture clear audio within 9.8 feet of range. Users will get 300 minutes of transcription per month for free and As compared to the Note Pro, this device has a shorter recording range and lower battery life. But it is smaller in size to carry using any of the above mentioned accesories. The company said that the pin is suited for people who are constantly on the go. Image Credits: Plaud This is Plaud’s fourth device, and the company has sold more than 1.5 million devices until now. With these devices, the focus has been on in-person meetings. However, Plaud also wants to take on meeting notetakers like Granola, Fathom, and Fireflies with a new desktop client that works across meeting apps. The company said that the app can detect when a meeting is active and prompt you to capture the transcript. The Mac app takes notes using system audio to capture the meeting, and then structures the transcription into notes using AI. The company introduced multimodal inputs for notetaking with its app that allows users to add images and typed notes along with audio transcription last year. Plaud is bringing that functionality to its desktop app as well.","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:28:10 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:03.444825

The company unveiled these earbuds ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and said that it plans to ship them in the U.S. in the next few months. The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a custom chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked. The startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that the buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model. In a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was whispering. “We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call. Last year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble announced forthcoming rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with the app, it wants to provide the functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package. Users can pre-order these buds using the startup’s site. The earbuds are available in black and white colorways.

Jeff Bezos led the way. The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sanchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business, and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion. Most of these sales happened through pre-arranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million. The common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 23:45:07 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:04.106623

While state residents have had the right to demand that a company stop collecting and selling their data since 2020, doing so required a laborious process of opting out with each individual company. The Delete Act, passed in 2023, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information. Now the Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request. Once DROP users verify that they are California residents, they can submit a deletion request that will go to all current and future data brokers registered with the state. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that all your data will be deleted immediately. Brokers are supposed to start processing requests in August 2026, then they have 90 days to actually process requests and report back. If they don’t delete your data, you’ll have the option to submit additional information that may help them locate your records. Companies will also be able to keep first-party data that they’ve collected from users. It’s only brokers who seek to buy or sell that data — which can include your social security number, browsing history, email address, phone number, and more — who will be required to delete it. Some information, such as vehicle registration and voter records, is exempt from deletion because it comes from public documents. Other data, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA. The California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

In a Thursday evening post on X, Lichtenstein said he was out early “thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act” (a prison reform bill passed during Trump’s first term). “I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein said. “To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.” The Department of Justice arrested Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan in 2022 and seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoins that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The couple became infamous after their arrest and were featured in a Netflix documentary called “Biggest Heist Ever.” Lichtenstein eventually admitted to his role in the hack and was sentenced to five years in prison. It’s not clear whether the Trump administration played a direct role in the release. An administration official told CNBC that Lichtenstein “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.”","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:48:23 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:04.789717

On Friday, India’s IT ministry issued the order directing Musk’s X to take corrective action on Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law. India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down. However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found. The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws. “It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes. India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible — and more politically sensitive — than those of stand-alone AI tools. X and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s order.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:29:26 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:05.157581

You quickly realize how much your old roommates helped out with stuff you took for granted, like light bulbs, smoke detectors, and even a vacuum. To make your new place feel more like home, here are some must-have gadgets that can really help you out. SimpliSafe Home Security System — $282.94 Image Credits:SimpliSafe A home security system is a worthwhile investment to ensure your peace of mind in a new apartment. SimpliSafe offers an easy-to-install setup that’s perfect for renters. It’s tool-free to set up, which is a huge perk for renters since you can place sensors on doors and windows with adhesive strips instead of drilling holes. The starter kit is tailored for small spaces and includes everything you need for basic home security: a base station, wireless keypad, one motion sensor, and one entry sensor. You can also buy additional sensors — such as glass-break, water, and temperature sensors — and cameras as needed. SimpliSafe offers two monitoring options. You can choose to monitor the system yourself or opt for professional monitoring with a subscription plan starting at $23 per month. This includes 24/7 coverage, so if an alarm is triggered, SimpliSafe will reach out to you or dispatch the police if you’re unreachable. Kidde Smart Smoke Detector — $74.97 Image Credits:Kidde While we’re on the subject of safety, a smoke detector is essential. Kidde’s Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detector is highly regarded, and the most notable aspect is that it sends alerts directly to your phone. Another nice detail is that the sensor is designed to avoid false alarms, like cooking smoke.

Eufy Robot Vacuum Image Credits:Eufy A robot vacuum can make cleaning a breeze. Whether you’re just trying to keep your hardwood floors tidy, deep cleaning couches, or dealing with pet hair, Eufy is a reputable brand that can help make your life easier. Depending on what you need, you can find new models like the E28, which has fancy features like a HydroJet system for floor washing, hot air drying, and automatic self-emptying. It’s pricier at around $1,399.99, but if you’re more budget-conscious, the 3-in-1 E20 is a solid option at $649.99 and still gets the job done. Dyson’s HushJet Purifier — $349.99 Image Credits:Dyson Fresh air is also important, but if you’re in the city, pollution makes it less ideal to open your apartment windows. And if neighbors are frequently cooking, you might deal with an odd mix of smells. An air purifier can significantly improve the quality of your indoor air. This compact device from Dyson is quite effective, although it’s on the pricier side. However, the noise level is pleasantly low and many people may find value in the fact that the filter lasts up to five years, which means you won’t need to purchase replacement filters as often. There’s also a convenient app that allows you to track air quality. Hatch Sunrise Alarm — $169.99 Image Credits:Hatch Without the presence of a roommate stirring around at the crack of dawn, waking up can become a challenge. If traditional phone alarms don’t cut it, this is where the Hatch Restore 3 comes in. This sunrise alarm gently wakes you by gradually increasing the light. It also includes soothing sleep sounds, a bedside light, and a dimmable clock that’s designed not to be disruptive. Yogasleep Sound Machine — $54.99 Image Credits:Yogasleep If you’re sensitive to noise or live in a pet-friendly building with frequent disturbances, a sound machine is perfect. Yogasleep has built a reputation for reliability over the years, making it a go-to choice for drowning out unwanted noise and creating a peaceful environment. Philips Hue Smart Lights Creating a cozy atmosphere in your first apartment is key, and smart light bulbs offer a great way to customize both brightness and color. An added bonus is that they can be controlled through an app or a voice assistant, making it easy to set the perfect lighting for movie nights, dinner parties, or late-night reading sessions. Philips Hue is a trusted brand in smart lighting that offers a range of popular products. What people appreciate most are the app’s features, which make it simple to turn lights on and off, adjust their colors, and set up lighting scenes for different times of day. One notable feature is the ability to upload a photo, and the app will create a new scene based on that color palette. Starter kits are priced from $79.99, while a two-pack of bulbs costs around $49.98. Leviton’s Smart Dimmer Plug — $24.99 Image Credits:Leviton Smart plugs allow you to control any device plugged into them via a mobile app or voice commands. They provide added convenience, such as turning off your coffee maker while away from home or scheduling when your devices should turn on or off. Plus, they help reduce energy consumption. A great option is Leviton’s Decora D23LP smart plug, which works with popular smart home ecosystems such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home. This plug allows you to not only turn connected devices on and off but also to dim them as needed. You can control the plug through the My Leviton app. Lumi Max Portable Projector — $399 Image Credits:Lumi Labs A lightweight projector that’s super compact and stands upright is great for small spaces and easy to tuck away when you’re done. Look for models that run on Google TV, which gives you access to over 10,000 apps, 700,000 movies and shows, plus 800 free live TV channels. Setting one up is easy if you have a Google account, and it comes with a remote and carrying case. Ninja Air Fryer — $79 If you’re cooking for yourself in a compact kitchen, an air fryer is invaluable. It allows you to whip up everything from crispy chicken wings to perfectly roasted vegetables while keeping your cooking area tidy. The Ninja Air Fryer is a top choice for budget-friendly, yet powerful, easy cooking.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:05.559619

Tesla delivered 1.63 million vehicles globally in 2025, a 9% fall from 1.79 million in 2024, according to figures released by the company. Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S. Tesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday. Tesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country. But it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from the previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers. Tesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics. And yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:17:47 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:05.947721

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. The billion-dollar-round club OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. The many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Deals of over a $100 million Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:06.369635

19,19.0,19.0,19.0,19.0,19.0,19.0,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/pebble-reboots-its-thinnest-smartwatch-with-the-pebble-round-2/,Pebble reboots its thinnest smartwatch with the Pebble Round 2,"Shortly after bringing back the Pebble smartwatch and launching a low-cost AI smart ring, Pebble is readying yet another new product: the Pebble Round 2. As the name suggests, this latest device is another version of the Pebble smartwatch, but with a rounded screen, giving it a more upscale look. But like other Pebble devices, the new watch is still an affordable purchase at $199. Pebble keeps its smartwatches’ cost down by limiting what they can do. In the case of the new Pebble Round 2, the device offers basic health and activity tracking, like steps and sleep, but it doesn’t include a heart rate monitor or other features that would make it a fitness or sports watch alternative. The trade-off is longer battery life — the Pebble Round 2 should last 10 to 14 days before needing a charge. Like the recently launched Pebble Time 2, the Pebble Round 2 is the company’s reboot of an older smartwatch. Back in 2015, Pebble launched its first rounded watch with the Pebble Time Round, which the company called the industry’s thinnest smartwatch at the time. The newer version maintains that slim look, at just 8.1 mm in thickness, compared with the original’s 7.5 mm. Image Credits:Pebble “[The Pebble Time Round] was, by far, one of my favorite Pebbles, but it wasn’t perfect,” said Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky in an interview with TechCrunch. “It had a few things we could improve, most notably being the gigantic bezel around the edge.” To make the original rounded watch face, the team had used an octagonal piece of glass with rounded edges that were hidden by a large bezel. But the result was a device that didn’t have a very large screen. Technology has since improved, of course, so the new device’s larger screen allows you to see more text. The updated design looks better, too. The touchscreen is now a 1.3″ color e-paper display (260 x 260 pixels at 283 DPI — or twice as many pixels as the original Pebble Time Round). The screen has a backlight, too, so you can see it at night. Under the hood, the Round 2 runs the open source Pebble OS. Image Credits:Pebble The watch’s dual microphones, meanwhile, allow for speech input and replying to messages. (This is currently an Android-only feature, because of Apple’s restrictions. But iOS will be supported in the EU in the days ahead.) The side buttons let you do things like silence incoming calls, play and pause music, navigate, go back, and scroll. Migicovsky says one advantage of buttons is that they allow you to use the watch without having to look down. “Say, for example, someone’s calling, and you’re in a meeting, and you just don’t want to answer the call,” he said. “You don’t even want to look at your watch. You always know that the bottom button cancels the call. Or if you’re listening to music and you’ve got AirPods in and you don’t want to fiddle with the AirPods or look at your phone, you always know that the center button pauses music.” Image Credits:Pebble The watch also has a stainless steel frame, accelerometer, and magnetometer, and includes a silicone watch band and a Pebble charge dongle. Leather bands will be made available separately. There are three watch color options to choose from, but each supports different band sizes. The matte black has a 20 mm quick-release band; the silver supports either a 14 mm or 20 mm band; and the polished rose gold supports only the 14 mm band. The Pebble Round 2 can run thousands of apps and watch faces available on the Pebble Appstore, though developers will need to update their apps to support the rounded screen using the provided SDK. Among the apps that can be accessed are AI assistants, like those that support Claude and other popular assistants. Pebble is also working on AI features for its devices. The company recently launched an AI smart ring that can record audio and transcribe conversations. When asked, Migicovsky said functionality similar to what’s in the ring will later come to Pebble watches, too. The new Pebble Round 2 will be available for preorder on January 2 from Pebble’s website. It should ship in May. Customers who previously ordered the Pebble Time 2 will also have the option to switch to the Pebble Round 2 if they choose.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:07.223095

Ahead of the CES show floor officially opening on Tuesday, January 6th, many companies have already announced new tech, gadgets, concepts, and AI-powered upgrades that will be released over this year. Yesterday’s CES Unveiled event delivered even more announcements and reveals. If you’re already struggling to keep on top of all the news coming out of the show, we’ve rounded up some of the best hardware and upgrades that have debuted so far. But there’s still more to come, so you can check back here every day, or catch up on all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage here. Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge First announced last month, The Verge’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential to carry around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.” Image: GE Appliances If you always seem to remember what groceries you need after you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping. Image: Clicks Clicks is best known for its smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the Pixel 9A, but you can reserve one now for a limited time to get a discount. Image: LG As TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the company’s Gallery+ service that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced. Lots of time to think about the robot uprising while folding laundry. Image: LG LG’s CLOiD is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house. IMAGE: Samsung Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: voice-activated door opening and closing. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand. Image: SwitchBot If you pulled a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet. Image: Petkit Petkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The Yumshare Daily Feast uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies. Image: LG Six years after its first Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017, LG has revived the line with its new LG OLED evo W6. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes. Image: GameSir GameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming Swift Drive gamepad that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet. Image: Yukai Engineering It’s not quite as adorable as the furry Mirumi robot that debuted at last year’s CES, but Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu is potentially more practical. It looks like a cuddly cat that’s huffing and puffing and features an internal fan that will keep young kids cool while preventing tiny fingers from reaching any dangerous moving parts. It’s expected to arrive in mid-2026 for $50 to $60.",2026-01-05T09:29:14-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:08.163706

Its new device, the Valet, is maybe its simplest idea ever: it’s a nice-looking tray designed to be the place you drop your keys, sunglasses, and other pocket detritus, and offers a couple of ways to charge whatever needs to be charged. It costs $179.99, and ships in the next couple of weeks. Most of the Valet tray is just… tray. It’s covered in a soft leather, which comes in several different colors. (You can also customize the outer metal frame to match.) On one side, a raised square acts like a podium for wireless charging up to 15 watts. You can plug in another USB cable to a port on the side, and charge a second device that way — again at 15 watts. The Valet itself plugs in via a 36-watt power supply, and comes with a 1.5-meter cable to do so. The charging specs make the Valet’s purpose pretty clear: This is not meant to be your laptop charger, or a charging hub of really any kind. It’s not even as straightforwardly functional as Twelve South’s own HiRise, which can charge three devices at a time. What it is, instead, is an attempt to make charging your most important devices — especially your phone — feel a bit more seamless. It’s the everlasting dream of wireless charging, really, to just put your device down wherever and have it full when you pick it up. Aligned on a podium isn’t exactly wherever, but I’ve been using a Valet and I have in fact enjoyed not hunting for cables so much. Mine’s sitting on my desk, but most Valets will likely end up on nightstands and in entryways. Twelve South is one of a lot of companies, including big names like Ikea, exploring gadgets that look more like home decor than high tech. This year’s CES is filled with gadgets trying to hide their essential gadget-ness, and while the Valet may not be the most earth-shattering example of the idea, it’s a pretty useful one.",2026-01-05T09:14:45-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:08.670848

Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Microsoft is preparing to launch a major UI refresh of its Edge browser soon. The software maker has started bringing the design language from Copilot to early Canary and Dev test versions of its Microsoft Edge browser. Design changes include a settings section that looks identical to the Copilot app, updated context menus, and an updated new tab page. Windows Central reports that Edge will also have rounded corners and use the same colors and fonts used by Microsoft’s Copilot app. The new UI of Microsoft Edge isn’t tied to the Copilot Mode of Microsoft’s browser, either. Microsoft appears to be pushing ahead with using Copilot’s unique design language inside Edge, and it could mean we see elements of this UI across Microsoft’s other web properties and perhaps even inside Windows at some point in the future. The upcoming new tab page in Edge looks just like Copilot. Image: Windows Central Even Edge’s settings page is getting Copilot styling. Image: Windows Central Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman revealed last year that Microsoft’s path forward with Edge is to evolve the browser, rather than create a whole new AI browser. “There isn’t going to be a new browser; this is just going to be one experience,” said Suleyman in an interview with Notepad. Weaving the Copilot design language more closely into Edge will certainly make Microsoft’s browser feel like it’s more focused on AI features than it does today. Microsoft’s Copilot design language is radically different to the Fluent design system the company uses across many of its products. Copilot first got this overhauled design after most of the Inflection AI team joined Microsoft in 2024. The design is almost identical to the Pi AI assistant that Inflection AI was working on.",2026-01-05T09:14:36-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:09.211701

The Affirm Series of smart locks will come in both deadbolt and latch editions. What’s more, the locks will support several ways to allow access, including not only the usual numeric keypad, but NFC access, so they can be used with physical and digital NFC key cards. The ability to access NFC means that you can either use a physical card to unlock a door, or import a key card into your digital wallet and use your phone instead, offering an alternative to the keypad. Other features include built-in Wi-Fi, so that you will not need a separate hub. The Lockly Affirm series of smartlocks will go on sale late in the second quarter of 2026 and will be priced at $179.99. The Lockly TapCom platform has been designed to help with short-term rentals. Image: Lockly Other products being introduced at the same time include the Lockly TapCom platform, which has been designed to help with short-term rentals via a video intercom and NFC tap interaction, among other features, and which is now available for $24.99, along with subscriptions for additional options. There is also the Lockly OwlGuard Security Camera, a smart home camera with offline monitoring, 2K wide-angle resolution, and AI detection of people, pets, and vehicles; and the Lockly Smart Safe XL, which includes AI-enhanced biometric access and the ability to switch between using a keypad, a fingerprint, or a smartphone app. The security camera will be sold for $99 in the second quarter of this year, while the safe will be first available outside the US in the second quarter of 2026 and introduced in the US sometimes in the third quarter. It will be priced at $339.99.",2026-01-05T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:09.915576

A new company called TDM, or “Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter,” has announced its first pair of wireless headphones at CES 2026 with a unique multifunctional design. The Neo look like a traditional pair of over-ear wireless headphones but feature an extra flexible headband that can be twisted and rolled up around the ear cups to turn them into a compact wireless speaker. Headphones that double as speakers aren’t an entirely new idea, but previous offerings either use ear cups that rotate 180 degrees to face outward, or ear cups with an open-back design so that everything you listen to is heard by those around you. The Neo take a different approach. A pair of 40mm drivers on the inside of the ear cups are used in headphone mode so your listening remains private. Switching to speaker mode, either by pressing a button or rolling the Neo up, turns those interior drivers off and activates a second pair of outward-facing 40mm drivers so your music can be shared. TDM claims impressive battery life of up to 200 hours in headphone mode, but that drops to just over 10 hours in speaker mode while those 40mm drivers are pumping out more sound. The Neo uses a pair of rechargeable 1,500mAh batteries that are user-replaceable, potentially prolonging the life of the headphones. Wireless connectivity is handled through Bluetooth 6 with multipoint and Auracast support, or you can also use a 3.5mm audio cable with older devices. There’s also a microphone for making calls or activating voice assistants including Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant in headphone or speaker mode. TDM plans to make the Neo headphones available through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign launching in January 2026. They’ll be available in black or white color options for $249. That positions them at the higher end of the wireless headphone spectrum, but they’re missing a popular feature typically found at that price point: active noise cancelling. The Neo only rely on their memory foam ear cushions to passively block unwanted sounds. Even with the added speaker functionality, that could make them a tough sell.",2026-01-05T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:10.419748

Content creation gadget maker ShiftCam is launching a superfast mobile SSD that sticks to the back of your phone for safekeeping. The Planck Studio was made with production teams and creators in mind, according to ShiftCam, providing devices like phones, laptops, and cameras with up to 8TB of additional storage and transfer speeds of up to 3,700MB/s. There are two storage sizes available: a 4TB option for $399 and a larger 8TB version for $599, which will both be available starting in early March. The Planck Studio features a USB-C port that supports the latest USB4 standard and a built-in screen that displays the name identifier, transfer speed, and available storage capacity. Unlike ShiftCam’s smaller Planck SSDs, it can stick to the back of your phone using magnets like a wireless charging brick, similar to other mobile SSDs like SanDisk’s Dockcase and Creator Phone SSD, which makes it easier to keep track of when transferring files between your devices. If you do happen to lose the Planck Studio, however, also integrates with Apple and Google’s device finder networks to help you navigate to its current location.",2026-01-05T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:10.875179

GE Lighting is launching smart shades at CES that come in at a pretty reasonable (for motorized shades, at least) $299.99. They’re not the cheapest smart shades out there. SwitchBots start at just $199, but they’re still quite a bit more affordable than Lutron’s, which start at $399. They should look pretty sleek, too, since they hide all their mounting hardware. The new GE shades come in white or gray with silver trim and offer either light filtering or full blackout options. If you’re worried about integrating them into your current smart home setup, they support Matter, so compatibility shouldn’t be too much of an issue if you’ve got a modern smart home hub. But if you’ve got older gear you can’t be bothered to upgrade, don’t worry, GE includes a remote in the box.",2026-01-05T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:11.298606

He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed. CES is poised to be the story of RGB LED, with almost every major TV manufacturer set to show off their latest models using the technology. But TCL is hoping to change that narrative, or even overtake it, with its own story — that of the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV. The X11L uses blue LEDs for its backlight, much like current mini-LED TVs, but it includes two important color improvements — reformulated quantum dots that provide more color than previously, and the UltraColor Filter from TCL CSOT (the company’s panel division) to take advantage of those new QDs and deliver more accurate color per pixel. It means the X11L can achieve 100 percent of the BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB color gamuts. It’s also one of the brightest ever displays released, capable of up to 10,000 nits of peak brightness and has up to 20,000 dimming zones (with presumably the 98-inch model hitting that number), which is three times more than on TCL’s QM9K. I don’t expect we’ll see any other TV this year with both these new quantum dots and an improved color filter. When compared to RGB LED TVs, both technologies claim 100 percent of BT.2020, but that’s while using test patterns. With real content (of which there’s very little using the full BT.2020 gamut), RGB LED TVs can experience color crosstalk, where the light from the different colored LEDs bleed into one another and can cause a lack of color saturation. Since the X11L uses the same color LEDs for its backlight, instead relying on the new quantum dots and improved color filter to create color, there’s no color crosstalk or loss of saturation. The X11L will be one of the few TVs in 2026 that will support Dolby Vision 2, which it will receive in an OTA update later in the year. We, of course, still need Dolby Vision 2 content to be created and released to take advantage of the HDR tech, but its inclusion futureproofs the TV. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports, will support the Xbox Game Pass app for playing games without a console (also an OTA update down the line), and includes Gemini for Google TV. TCL continues its support of Dolby Atmos Flex Connect technology, allowing for the connection of TCL Flex Connect speakers and sub to expand your home theater. Saying that, the Bang & Olufsen speakers built in to the TV perform incredibly well. I heard a demo in December, and it’s easily one of the best TV speaker systems I’ve ever heard with an immersive soundscape and deep bass. We won’t have to wait long to see the X11L, as the 85- and 98-inch models are available for preorder now with the 75-inch version coming a few months later (no firm date yet for it). It’s not a cheap TV out of the gate (what new technology is?), with the 98-inch coming in at $9,999.99, the 85-inch at $7,999.99, and $6,999.99 for the 75-inch. But TCL has a tendency to drop its prices as the year gets on. The 85-inch X11K was originally $9,999.99 at release and its price has now plummeted to $3,499.99. Fingers crossed the same happens later in the year with the X11L.",2026-01-05T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:11.829524

Smart calendars can be a boon for busy families that have room for them, but Cozyla’s latest concept is pushing that to the limit if you’re short on space. The 55-inch Cozyla Calendar Plus Max announced at CES is a Wi-Fi-enabled 4K touchscreen display on a wheeled stand, which Cozyla says is the “largest smart interactive hub in its category.” The size of smart calendars can vary, with some being small enough to sit on a table or desk, while the largest models — like the 27-inch Skylight Calendar Max — are typically wall-mounted. Cozyla’s largest retail model is the 32-inch Calendar Plus 2, which is still substantially smaller than the Plus Max concept if you include the optional floor stand. Even portable displays like LG’s StanbyMe and Samsung’s Movingstyle are more compact, which makes the Cozyla Calendar Plus Max feel like something better suited to classrooms and offices. Instead, Cozyla is pitching its massive smart display to modern households, where it’s designed to help with managing family schedules, meal planning, video calls, learning, fitness, entertainment, and home security. The Calendar OS supports integrations with calendar apps from Apple, Google, and more, and Cozyla says the Calendar Plus Max will allow users to stream shows and run fitness apps. It’s so tall that young children may not be able to interact with it. Image: Cozyla The Calendar Plus Max’s camera could be useful for live interactive fitness apps. Image: Cozyla The device is expected to include speakers, microphones, and a camera, providing support for Zoom, FaceTime, and Cozyla video calls. Cozyla also says the Calendar Plus Max will integrate with “home security systems, cameras, and sensors” to display live feeds and real-time alerts, but the company didn’t specify which smart home platforms or security devices would be supported. Given this is a concept device, the Calendar Plus Max isn’t guaranteed to become a real product that you can actually buy, but I certainly envy anyone who has a large enough home to consider it.",2026-01-05T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 14:43:12.249190

The big highlights are obviously the addition of Nano Banana and Veo support for creating AI videos and images directly on your TV. This can be anything from modifying your family photos for a laugh to creating “original” video clips on your TV. (Though how “original” anything spit out by an AI generator can be is up for debate.) Those tools can also be paired with Gemini to search your Google Photos library to pull together stylized slideshows of particular events in your life. In general, Gemini’s responses will be more visual, including images or video context for your queries, as well as real-time sports updates. Gemini will also generate “deep dives” with narrated interactive elements on topics you choose. If all of that seems like fun, but not particularly useful, fair. But Google will also be granting Gemini new voice-control capabilities. You’ll now be able to change various settings just by telling Gemini simple things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue.” It will then adjust the picture or volume accordingly. Maybe one day you’ll even be able to do a cartoonish double take and shout, “Wait, what?” to have Google skip back and turn on closed captioning to make sure you heard correctly.

The show faced significant barriers to US popularity—namely, the deep-rooted resistance to subtitles in the US, and the psychological distance from other cultures many Westerners feel. About 70 percent of the dialog was spoken in Japanese, and many of the principal cast members were actors not yet widely known in the United States. The fact that the show nevertheless held viewers’ interest pleased Marks. “I think the viewers enjoyed the experience of discovering a culture they did not understand through the story,"" he says. “This is because the algorithm only presents choices that are similar to past choices, so choices that venture into an unknown culture are unlikely to be recommended in the first place.” The success of Shogun showed that the desire for such “discovery” certainly existed. Condou worked on the story with Marks (who is also her husband) both together and separately. “We worked on the script in different rooms, going back and forth from room to room. He would delete words and I would put them back in, and sometimes we would argue.

31,31.0,31.0,31.0,31.0,31.0,31.0,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-magnesium-supplements-good-for/,Magnesium Supplements Crash Course (2026): Benefits and Side Effects,"“It’s really overlooked that magnesium can help with menstrual cycle irregularity in terms of making sure that you’re not having severe cramping,” says Anderson-Haynes, who adds it may also benefit women in perimenopause and menopause. Clinically, it may be part of the treatment for pregnancy complications like preeclampsia and eclampsia. Can You Take Too Much? The recommended dietary allowance is 320 milligrams per day for women and 420 milligrams per day for men. These are amounts most people can reach with a balanced diet; healthy kidneys regulate magnesium levels, excreting excess when magnesium intake is high and conserving it when it’s low. Daily supplements under 350 milligrams are generally considered safe for healthy adults. “If you take too much magnesium, you’ll probably get diarrhea, because it loosens the bowels,” Anderson-Haynes says. Other side effects include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and, at very high levels of magnesium (usually from overusing laxatives or antacids), low blood pressure, muscle cramps, breathing problems, and, in rare cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease are at the highest risk of toxicity. Should You Supplement? For most healthy U.S. adults, magnesium supplements aren’t essential. If you struggle with migraines, insomnia, or other conditions where research suggests health benefits, they may be worth trying—but first talk to a health care professional. Otherwise, focus on magnesium-rich foods. These include but are not limited to: legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), leafy greens (artichokes, kale, spinach), whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa), nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), fruit (bananas, avocado, dried apricots), and soy products (tofu, soy milk, edamame). Dark chocolate is also a good source of magnesium; 100 grams of 70-85 percent of cacao solids contain 228 milligrams of magnesium, which is more than half of the amount of magnesium recommended for daily intake. If you do decide to take any dietary supplements, “look for a seal or certification that says GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or NSF,” says Anderson-Haynes, stressing the importance of third-party tests and verifications, considering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate dietary supplements in the US. Our Favorite Magnesium Supplements Pure Encapsulations was recommended to me by my doctor, and it seems to be the company that health care professionals trust the most. I prefer capsules over powders when it comes to magnesium glycinate because I'm taking these right before bed and usually can't stomach a liquid concoction. Each capsule contains 120 milligrams, and you can take one to four capsules a day depending on what your doctor recommends. While magnesium glycinate is often taken for sleep and a better mood, it also supports heart health, cellular energy production, and bone structure. It's also less likely to have a laxative effect if you're usually sensitive to magnesium supplements. Pure Encapsulations sells several forms of magnesium, in capsule, powder, and liquid form. Thorne (NSF Certified for Sport) is one of the brands we trust the most when it comes to dietary supplements, mostly because they rigorously test their products for potency, purity, and label accuracy through every step of the process. They screen raw materials for contaminants in their in-house laboratories. They check the supplements, including the bottles and labels, for defects. Before hitting the shelves, they ensure that no microbiological contamination has occurred during the manufacturing process. Lastly, products undergo stability testing to confirm that they will meet their label claims up to the expiration date. Thorne also offers travel packs, capsules, multivitamins that contain magnesium, and other forms of magnesium, including Magnesium CitraMate, which is a blend of magnesium citrate and di-magnesium malate. Courtesy of Buoy Buoy Rainforest Activated Magnesium $88 Buoy Many health care providers have drilled into me that you should get nutrients, like magnesium, from food as opposed to supplements. Like most people, I have trouble getting enough leafy greens and seeds in my diet. Buoy’s Rainforest Activated Magnesium does the job (and adds a minty undertone to my morning smoothies). This magnesium powder is formulated with plants sourced from the Australian rainforest, including anise myrtle, shiitake mushrooms, and pumpkin seed meal. Theoretically, these aid in better absorption and make the supplement more metabolically useful. I’m still following the doctor’s orders of using food sources, and I sleep more deeply when regularly using it. —Julia Forbes Meet the Experts Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, MS, RDN, CDCES, is a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and founder of 360Girls&Women.

It's made from BPA-free plastic, has a five-layer filtration system and a stainless steel top reservoir, there's a transparent water tank for easier monitoring, and it comes in a bunch of cute colors. The spout is tall and has a continuous flow, making it ideal for cats who love to drink from faucets. However, it's not connected to an app, so you'll have to monitor water levels and set manual reminders for filter replacement and cleaning. The plastic is also harder to clean, and it has a wired pump, which makes cleaning trickier (water and electricity are never an ideal combo). It's a solid model that's worked effectively, but there are better options out there at this price point. Photograph: Molly Higgins Petkit Eversweet Max for $80: This techy automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered (lasting up to 83 days), and the drinking bowl is made of stainless steel, but the reservoir is plastic. Because of the shape of the basin with the chunky battery and reservoir bowl, it’s a little awkward to clean. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed. The app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you last added water. However, it doesn’t monitor or show you how much water is left in the basin; you have to check manually. The design also made it a bit difficult to clean and refill easily. Photograph: Molly Higgins Enabot Rola Smart Pet Water Fountain for $46: This automatic fountain is cordless and runs on a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 60 days (although it can stay plugged in too). It has a wireless pump that uses magnetic induction—this pump was one of the easiest and most hassle-free to clean of all I tested. The fountain has a stainless steel top that holds a decent amount of water even when not running. However, the tank is plastic—I’m wary of plastic because of its propensity to harbor bacteria (plus it doesn't keep water as cold). The app gives reminders of when the water’s low, the fountain needs cleaning, or the filter needs replacing, plus it automatically stops dispensing water and sends you a reminder to refill via its app. It also logs the number of times your pet drank and for how long, monitoring hydration patterns over time. A complaint I had is that this fountain wouldn’t stay on Continuous stream mode, even when plugged in, instead automatically switching to the Sensing stream. Homerunpet Wireless Pet Fountain for $60: This cordless fountain can be used as a traditional fountain plugged in on its base, or can be detached and moved around the house with 30 days of battery life. I don't love that this fountain is all plastic, but it's easy to see water levels from the outside, the top and filter layers are super easy to remove, clean, and replace, and the wireless (basically silent) pump makes it a whole lot easier to clean. Plastic doesn't keep the water as cold or clean as stainless steel, so you'll have to clean it a lot more often. The fountain only begins bubbling when a cat (or human) approaches to save battery power, and there's no option to control the flow (and no connected app). I like the wireless pump, but I'm really over plastic at this point. Photograph: Kat Merck Wonder Creature Cat Fountain for $19: My two cats have cycled through several water fountains over the past few years, but this no-nonsense version has been a stalwart. The inside is lit by a blue LED (bright enough to glow in the dark), and a clear viewing window on the side makes it easy to monitor the water level from afar. I also like the dishwasher-safe metal bowl and the fact you can remove parts of the white-and-yellow flower to create a fountain configuration your cat likes (waterfall, low bubble-up, tall bubble-up). The only major downsides are the fact it requires very frequent cleaning and filter changes due to the plastic body, and that there is no reservoir to hold water in case of power outage or pump malfunction. When I went on vacation, I had to swap it out for an old-school gravity dispenser. —Kat Merck Happy & Polly Gothic Cat Drinking Fountain for $66: If you prefer gothic decor to neutral blandness, this ghostly ceramic cat fountain from Happy & Polly may tempt you to bite. The water bubbles up out of the top of the ghost and pools on the ceramic top. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets loud when the water is running low, and I worry about the motor burning out, as the 1.5-liter capacity can run dry fast. While the ceramic finish is easy to clean, it is fiddly to take apart. You will want to clean it once a week to prevent it from becoming slimy, and you must change the filter once a month. —Simon Hill Petkit Eversweet Solo 2 for $45: I love three key features of this fountain: The bowl sits on top of a wireless charging base, so you don’t have to fiddle with cables, it is super easy to clean, and it's very quiet at around 25 decibels. A flashing light warns you when the water is running low, and you can check when the filter needs to be changed in the app. There’s an optional smart mode that pumps intermittently and a night mode to turn the light off. Pleasingly, all three of our cats drink from this fountain, though that does mean I have to refill it often, as it only holds 2 liters. —Simon Hill Photograph: Simon Hill Oneisall Stainless Steel Pet Fountain for $50: This drinking fountain is about as simple as they come. As it's designed for cats or small dogs, it has a large bowl, but some cats will prefer that. I love the mostly stainless steel construction, as it's easy to keep clean and less prone to dirt and bacteria buildup. You can even stick parts into the dishwasher to clean. This fountain can also hold up to 7 liters of water, so you don’t have to refill as often. It’s fairly quiet at around 35 decibels, but it gets louder when the water is running low (a red light warns you when it needs a refill). You should clean once a week and rinse the filter. The filter packs are relatively affordable, and you need to swap them once a month. —Simon Hill Photograph: Molly Higgins Petlipo Cordless Cat Water Fountain for $45: This all-plastic pet fountain sits on a dock for easier tank cleaning and is rechargeable for up to 60 days of cordless power. It has a wire-free pump, a large 2.6-liter capacity, and three customizable water flow modes (induction, timer, and continuous flow). The heavy-duty filter is encased in a plastic cage and only needs to be replaced every four to five weeks. I had no issues while using this fountain, but at nearly $50, it's egregiously expensive for being made out of cheap (and bacteria-harboring) plastic. Although it's a solid fountain, I'd spend less and grab a stainless steel model. Not Recommended Photograph: Molly Higgins Petcube Ceramic Pet Water Fountain for $90: I really wanted to love this fountain; although its basin is plastic, it had a ceramic top, which is more hygienic than plastic (and I had never tested a ceramic model before), and the brand makes some of my favorite pet cameras. However, setup was a bit confusing; it took a long time to get the base charged to power the fountain's water flow; and the sensor to start the water flow is only triggered from one side, making placement awkward. After a few days, it would only run while plugged in. Soon, its stream was barely strong enough to reach the top, and after just over a week, it stopped working altogether. Also, it's overly expensive for what it is. Photograph: Molly Higgins Cat Mate 3-Level Pet Fountain for $28: This tall automatic Cat Mate fountain sets itself apart with three tiers for cats who like to drink at every level. Cleaning the motor requires disassembly using tools and extended soaking. Because of the long distance the water has to travel, evaporation causes the water to need to be refilled about every other day. Plastic also harbors bacteria, and previous plastic models I’ve owned have had mold issues. The basin is quite large and sits flat. Because of this, some debris would sit in the bottom and front of the large basin rather than moving back to the filter system behind. The plastic material and lack of ergonomic gravity design caused this fountain to be dirtier than others. Photograph: Molly Higgins Whisker City Free Fall Cat Fountain for $40: This huge fountain is better suited for dogs, with its 150-fluid-ounce bowl and waterfall design. Although the basin has a small splash pad to help offset the waterfall noise, this was one of the loudest fountains I tested. The evaporation from the waterfall-like system also caused me to refill it every other day. Because of the structure of the fountain, my cats had to bend their head at an awkward angle. They tended to avoid drinking from the basin because of that, and their heads got slightly wet from the splatter of the waterfall. The basin is also not angled, so crumbs and debris sit at the bottom of the bowl. Photograph: Molly Higgins Petkit EverSweet Solo SE for $26: This very simple, straightforward fountain has a square-shaped body, is translucent to easily see water levels from he outside, and has a nearly silent 25-decibel cordless pump to circulate water from the basin to the top level, where 2 ounces of water is always available for drinking, even in case of power failure. The basin sits on a base and all parts easily detach, making it easier to clean. This fountain doesn’t have multiple modes or an associated app—you’ll have to check water levels manually. I noticed this fountain didn't keep water as cold as some of the others, and because of the design of the top, debris often pooled in the dipped areas, which required more frequent cleaning. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I used each of these for a week as my cats’ main source of water. As mentioned, I noted the ease of setting up, evaluated parts and filters, and generally compared the various types of water fountains—spigot, bubbling, or waterfall. Some flows were continuous and some were intermittent (my cats didn’t prefer intermittent). Cats may also be intrigued and want to play with the machine rather than drink, so be sure to give them time and keep another water source around until they are fully adjusted to the new gadget. Why a Fountain? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Cats sometimes struggle to consume enough water, which can lead to potentially lethal UTIs and blockages in male cats especially. This is one of the reasons vets are moving more toward encouraging owners to give their cat at least a partially wet food diet, as this helps them consume more moisture, especially since cats don’t naturally consume as much water as dogs. Unlike dogs, cats are generally quite particular in their likes and dislikes, and cats can see stagnant water as potentially harmful. (If the cat was in the wild, stagnant water has more potential for harmful bacteria). Cats are more drawn to moving water in nature, and these fountains help encourage them to drink more by emulating what they’re naturally drawn to. While automatic water fountains are better for your cats' overall water consumption, they do require a bit more work and money. Rather than refilling a bowl, these take a little more elbow grease—but it’s worth it for your cat’s health. Along with routine refilling and cleaning, you’ll need to disassemble the fountain to clean all parts, including using a brush for the bowl and tubes. You may also have to disassemble the motor to deep-clean because of mineral buildup. These also have different types of filtration cartridges in specific shapes for the brand’s fountains, which require you to buy and change out filters, usually monthly but sometimes more often. What I Look For AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Let’s be honest, a lot of these fountains are pretty much the same. I looked especially for the overall design—I am a fiend for stainless steel because of the potential of porous plastic harboring harmful bacteria. I also favor a wide reservoir without high sides to help reduce the chance for whisker fatigue. I prefer fountains that have a small basin reservoir of water available at all times, in case of low water levels or power failure. I took into account ease of setting up, refilling, and cleaning, as well as overall design. And of course, there were some that my cats took to straight away, and some they didn’t seem to favor as much. After prolonged testing, I now look for these three things and encourage you too as well: a cordless pump for easier (and safer) cleaning, constructed from stainless steel so it's more hygienic, and a window to monitor water levels (especially if it's not connected to an app).

You couldn’t always trust the words coming out of his mouth, Schmitz said, because sometimes they weren’t really his words—or his mouth. Schmitz had become the target of AI-generated impersonation scams. “You’re being watched by a demonic human,” said the fake Schmitz in one video that the real Schmitz, wearing an L.L. Bean jacket over his clerical suit, included in his public service announcement as an example. “You must act quickly, because the spots for sending prayers are already running out,” said another fake Schmitz with a looming hourglass behind him. “And the next trip will only take place in four months.” The fake Schmitz sounded ever-so-slightly robotic as he urged viewers to click a link and secure their blessing before it was too late. “I can look at them and say ‘That’s ridiculous, I would never say that,’” the real Schmitz, who is based in Duluth, Minnesota, said in his callout video. “But people can’t necessarily tell. That’s a problem. That’s, like, a really big problem.” On the real video of Schmitz, some of the top comments from his followers said they had seen other prominent Catholic figures impersonated through AI videos, including the pope. According to cybersecurity expert Rachel Tobac, who is the CEO of SocialProof Security, that’s because pastors have become extremely popular subjects of AI scams and other deceptive media. “If you’re on TikTok or Reels, they’ve probably come across your For You page,” Tobac says. “This is somebody who looks to be a priest, who’s wearing all of the garments, who’s standing up on a pulpit or a stage or whatever you’d call it, and they seem to be speaking to their congregation in a very enthusiastic way.” Pastors and ministers in Birmingham, Alabama, Freeport, New York, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, have warned their followers about AI scams impersonating them in the form of DMs, calls, and deepfakes. Alan Beauchamp, a pastor in the Ozarks, said his Facebook account was hacked, with the hacker posting a fake, possibly AI-generated certificate for cryptocurrency trading with Beauchamp’s name on it and a caption urging his congregants to join him. A megachurch in the Philippines received reports of deepfakes featuring its pastors. An evangelical church in Nebraska issued an AI “scammer alert” on Facebook, and one churchgoer in the comments posted a screenshot of texts purported to be from one of their pastors. It doesn’t help that a lot of the pastors and ministers who have grown large online followings often actually are soliciting donations and selling things, just not the same things that their AI impersonators are. With the help of social media, religious authority figures have been able to reach believers far beyond their neighborhoods, but the proliferation of content featuring their likenesses and voices has also provided the perfect opportunity for scammers wielding generative AI tools.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:15.863616

What Matters Is How You Use It","The New Year’s Eve champagne isn’t even warm yet, and CES week is already upon us. The giant annual celebration of consumer tech kicks off the first full week of January as companies across the world convene in Las Vegas to hawk their latest innovations. As always, WIRED will be keeping track of the deluge of tech announcements. Our intrepid team will be in Las Vegas, bounding around event spaces, trying on headsets and petting possibly several robot dogs, while sharing videos of the most important—and most bizarre—stuff we find. Follow along on our CES live blog or dive into all our event coverage. Everything Is AI; Nothing Is AI We are of course expecting artificial intelligence to feature prominently at CES for the third year in a row. Whether the AI race is an actual boom or just a bubble, the entire Earth is seemingly caught up in the trend of packing AI features into every new device. The rush of companies stuffing chatbots, computer vision, and intelligent sensors into their products has led to a sort of evening out—when products all offer similar features and use cases, they become harder to differentiate. “Everything is AI now, so nothing is AI,” says Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, who has said this kind of thing for a while now. “It has reached such a point of saturation that simply stating ‘AI’ doesn't really do anything.” Competing products may use AI capabilities to do all the same things, but the differences that make one win out over the other may come down to which one can figure out how to best deploy the software. “It's really a software maturity story,” Sag says. “But that's not very sexy.” Take smart glasses as an example. A heap of smart glasses will be announced at CES this year. Based on the emails already flowing into my inbox, these glasses will have just about anything you’d want—voice-activated chatbot search, sharp displays, instant language translation. But any new specs will have to compete with Meta, which has carved out quite a lead with its best-selling smart glasses. Meta has been able to refine its user experience and design for years now and, so far, its execution is unmatched. Extend this out to just about any product category and you’ll see the same thing.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:16.386482

In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the Pixel 10 series. After long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google’s new phones. And boy, do I regret it. The Journey to eSIM SIM cards have existed in some form since the 1990s. Back then, they were credit-card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They slimmed down over time, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. So now there’s eSIM. The eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, nonremovable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot. Apple was the first major smartphone maker to force the use of eSIM with the release of the iPhone 14, and it makes use of that space. The international iPhone 17 with a SIM card slot has a smaller battery than the eSIM-only version, but the difference is only about 8 percent. Google didn’t make the jump until this year with the Pixel 10 series—the US models are eSIM-only, but they unfortunately don’t have more of anything compared to the international versions. In advance of the shift, Android got system-level support for downloading and transferring eSIMs. But whatever can go wrong will go wrong, and it’s extremely annoying when eSIM goes wrong. Please Hold for Support There have been times when I swapped between phones on an almost daily basis—such was the nature of reviewing phones back when there were a dozen of them coming out every month. Never once in all those countless device swaps did I have a problem with my SIM card. As such, I managed to avoid contacting carrier support for years at a time. In the three months since Google forced me to give up my physical SIM card, I’ve needed to move my eSIM only occasionally. Still, my phone number has ended up stuck in limbo on two occasions. Android’s built-in tools work better than they used to, and I can’t say what is responsible for the eSIM corruption. However, carriers bear the responsibility for how annoying this is to fix. The first time, I was logged in to the mobile app for my carrier (T-Mobile). After a few minutes of back-and-forth with support, I was able to use the app to authenticate and get a new eSIM pushed to the phone. It was annoying but relatively painless. The second time a SIM transfer went sideways, I was not logged in to the app, and that was a problem.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:17.309841
37,37.0,37.0,37.0,37.0,37.0,37.0,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-flu-antivirals/,Flu Is Relentless. Crispr Might Be Able to Shut It Down,"As he addressed an audience of virologists from China, Australia, and Singapore at October’s Pandemic Research Alliance Symposium, Wei Zhao introduced an eye-catching idea. The gene-editing technology Crispr is best known for delivering groundbreaking new therapies for rare diseases, tweaking or knocking out rogue genes in conditions ranging from sickle cell disease to hemophilia. But Zhao and his colleagues at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity have envisioned a new application. They believe Crispr could be tailored to create a next-generation treatment for influenza, whether that’s the seasonal strains which plague both the northern and southern hemispheres on an annual basis, or the worrisome new variants in birds and other wildlife that might trigger the next pandemic. Crispr can edit the genetic code—the biological instruction book that makes life possible—within the cells of every living being. That means it can take different forms. The best-known version is mediated by the Cas9 enzyme; this can fix errors or mutations within genes by cutting strands of DNA. But virologists like Zhao are more interested in Cas9’s less famous cousin, the Cas13 enzyme, which can do the same to RNA. In human cells, RNA molecules carry instructions from DNA to make proteins, but the genetic code of influenza viruses is composed entirely of RNA strands—a vulnerability that Cas13 can exploit. “Cas13 can target these RNA viruses and inactivate them,” Zhao explained. Human cells do not naturally make either Cas9 or Cas13; both of these enzymes are found in the immune systems of bacteria and microscopic organisms called archaea., where Cas13 enables them to disable invading viruses called phages. Zhao and a wider team of scientists are devising an innovative system to confer the same benefits to humans. Initially pioneered in the lab as a novel Covid antiviral, their idea is to develop a nasal spray or an injection that uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver molecular instructions to flu-infected cells in the respiratory tract. It’s a two-stage process. The first molecule would be an mRNA that instructs the cells to make Cas13, with the second being a so-called guide RNA that directs Cas13 to a specific part of the influenza virus’s RNA code. “Cas13 then cuts the viral RNA, disrupting the virus’s ability to replicate and effectively stopping the infection at the genetic level,” says Sharon Lewin, an infectious diseases physician at the Peter Doherty Institute who is leading the project. While the main aim would be to use the technology as a way of curbing short-term infections, Zhao also envisions the spray being used to prevent infections, for example during a particularly virulent flu season. “You’d basically be preparing the cells in your respiratory tract to produce this Cas13, as a first layer of defense,” he says. “It’s like the army—you’d have those soldiers armed and ready to meet their enemy.”","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:17.729786

Getting It Might Not Be So Simple,"President Donald Trump has made it clear: His vision for Venezuela’s future involves the US profiting from its oil. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies—the biggest anywhere in the world—go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,” the president told reporters at a news conference Saturday, following the shocking capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife. But experts caution that a number of realities—including international oil prices and longer-term questions of stability in the country—are likely to make this oil revolution much harder to execute than Trump seems to think. ""The disconnect between the Trump administration and what's really going on in the oil world, and what American companies want, is huge,” says Lorne Stockman, an analyst with Oil Change International, a clean energy and fossil fuels research and advocacy organization. Venezuela sits on some of the largest oil reserves in the world. But production of oil there has plummeted since the mid 1990s, after President Hugo Chávez nationalized much of the industry. The country was producing just 1.3 million barrels of oil each day in 2018, down from a high of more than 3 million barrels each day in the late 1990s. (The US, the top producer of crude oil in the world, produced an average of 21.7 million barrels each day in 2023.) Sanctions placed on Venezuela during the first Trump administration, meanwhile, have driven production even further down. Trump has repeatedly implied that freeing up all that oil and increasing production would be a boon for the oil and gas industry—and that he expects American oil companies to take the lead. This kind of thinking—a natural offshoot of his “drill, baby, drill” philosophy—is typical for the president. One of Trump’s main critiques of the Iraq war, which he first voiced years before he ran for office, was that the US did not “take the oil” from the region to “reimburse ourselves” for the war. The president views energy geopolitics “almost like the world is a Settlers of Catan board—you kidnap the president of Venezuela and, ipso facto, you now control all the oil,” says Rory Johnston, a Canadian oil market researcher. “I do think he legitimately, to a degree, believes that. It’s not true, but I think that’s an important frame for how he's justifying and driving the momentum of his policy.”","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:25:38 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:18.177073

Amy Brownstein, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at MyNetDiary, says electrolytes are minerals that exist naturally in your body. These include magnesium, calcium, chloride, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous. Electrolyte powders usually contain these, as well as sugars and carbohydrates which can help a little bit with the absorption of the electrolytes. Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, says humans usually lose sodium when working out or spending time in hot temperatures and also that carbohydrates are important to help replenish and preserve muscle glycogen stores to prevent fatigue, especially if you'll be active for more than 30 minutes. Basically, if you're working out a lot and not replenishing lost carbs, you'll feel fatigued much faster—and that's especially true for intense workouts or long sporting events, in which case she recommends re-upping carbohydrates every 30 to 45 minutes. Sugars like glucose serve similar purposes, helping to replenish muscle glycogen as well. If you're just looking for supplements for day-to-day life or to soothe your hungover brain, you don't need as much sodium or carbohydrates. Brownstein says to choose a powder within the context of your daily habits and diet; most people already consume the recommended 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, so if you're not depleting sodium stores with intense exercise, you probably don't need a powder with a high sodium content. The same can be said for sugar. Ultimately, the best way to figure out exactly what you need is by getting a sweat test done to analyze the contents of your sweat. But short of doing that, your best bet is to choose a powder that lives somewhere in the middle of ingredient concentration—unless you're sweating a ton, working out in high heat, or training in high altitudes. Brownstein adds that if you notice white, chalky residue on your skin or clothes after working out, you might need to up your sodium intake. When it comes to synthetic dyes, Balls says that it comes down mostly to personal choice. Luckily, if you want to avoid these ingredients, many of our recommendations omit them. To avoid stomach upset, Balls mentions that you might want to look for powders that are lower in magnesium (which can have a laxative effect in high amounts). She also mentions that calcium and iron can interfere with the absorption of one another, so choose a powder that has balanced, lower amounts of those two supplements. Brownstein mentions that high sugar and sodium content can upset some peoples' stomachs too, and that you should read the labels to make sure you're not over-supplementing (or over-caffeinating). If something contains 100 percent of your daily recommended zinc content, for example, you want to make sure you're not also taking a multivitamin with the same amount of zinc. Per Heather Gosnell, a pediatrician, sodium is the key ingredient for effective rehydration. She also says a little sugar and carbohydrates help your body absorb water but to avoid high-sugar drinks. Balls says to look for a powder that includes the key electrolytes lost: sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. She says, if possible, to avoid drinks with artificial sweeteners. Hallie Zwibel, director of the Center for Sports Medicine at New York Institute of Technology, adds that “in addition to causing upset stomach and reduced fluid absorption, repeatedly consuming high-sugar foods and beverages can lead to diabetes, as well as potential weight gain.” He also said, “While electrolyte packets can help replenish essential minerals lost through sweat, they should not replace daily water intake.”","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:31:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:19.167032

All of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don’t need to think about it when they’re solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they’d expect, and carry on with their work. Descriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets—particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore. Their field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named Anton Bernshteyn published a deep and surprising connection between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science. He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There’s no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent. “This is something really weird,” said Václav Rozhoň, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.” Since Bernshteyn’s result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems. Some descriptive set theorists are even starting to apply insights from the computer science side to reorganize the landscape of their entire field, and to rethink the way they understand infinity.","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:19.720891

They're most helpful when whole foods aren't available or when your schedule won't allow for a proper meal. The most beneficial sources of protein come with fiber, healthy fats, and other nutrients. (That’s why registered dietitians recommend whole foods over ultra-processed alternatives.) So, while high-protein snacks may boast impressive counts on the label, they’re not always the healthiest option. After consulting the nutrition experts about key ingredients to look for (and what to avoid), we've rounded up the best protein bars that meet those standards. For more tips on protein, check out our guide to the Best Protein Powders and How Much Protein Do I Need? What Should I Look For in a Protein Bar? Start with the Nutrition Facts label. The first thing to check is serving size, since every number on the label applies to that portion. For most protein bars, one bar equals one serving, but it’s still worth confirming. Scan the Calories What’s “right” depends on your caloric needs. If it’s a snack between meals, around the 200-calorie range generally makes sense. If you’re trying to gain weight or looking for a meal replacement, you might want something closer to 350 calories. That said, experts don’t recommend protein bars as stand-ins for meals. They’re best used to supplement whole foods, which offer a wider range of nutrients that snack bars just can’t replicate. Check the Protein Content and Source “Ideally, we’d like to see protein bars offer 10 to 20 grams of protein,” says Jamie Mok, registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Just as important as the quantity is the source; protein derived from milk, soy, peas, or nuts are all common, effective options. Don’t Forget Fiber Fiber helps stabilize blood sugar, supports digestion, curbs cravings, and keeps you fuller for longer. According to Mok, around 5 grams of fiber per energy bar is a good benchmark, preferably from whole-food ingredients, like nuts, seeds, or oats. Ingredients to Avoid In general, the shorter and more recognizable the ingredient list, the better. High-protein bars can be as delicious as a Snickers. “They could also sneakily pack a lot of added sugar, and turn into a candy bar,” says Mok. There’s no official cutoff, but around 5 grams of added sugar or less is a reasonable benchmark. Check both the nutritional label and ingredient list: Syrups and concentrates are usually indicators of added sugars. Many brands lower their sugar count by using sugar alcohols (like erythritol, maltitol, or sorbitol). These provide fewer calories than sugar and don’t spike blood glucose the same way, but they can cause bloating, gas, or GI discomfort for some people, especially in higher doses. If you notice stomach issues after eating protein bars, sugar alcohols are often the culprit. You might tolerate one bar just fine, but eating several in a day can get uncomfortable. It’s also worth limiting bars that rely heavily on hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, which are more processed forms of fat, as well as those packed with long lists of artificial sweeteners (i.e., sucralose), colors, or flavors. Our Favorite Protein Bars Best Overall RxBar now offers a couple of different protein bars, but the Classic 12G remains the best. Made from whole foods, the base is a mix of egg whites—a complete protein—dates for sweetness and binding, and nuts (pecans, hazelnuts, cashews, walnuts, peanuts, almonds). I've taste-tested the Chocolate Sea Salt, but RxBar also sells Blueberry, Peanut Butter, Peanut Butter Chocolate, Vanilla Almond, Coconut Chocolate, and Strawberry. It has an uber-chewy, sticky texture, so if that's not your taste, there's a Nut Butter & Oat Variety Pack that swaps the dates for rolled oats.

While it is true that I will eat almost anything that's peanut-butter-flavored, the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk bars are actually good! I find the chewy texture appealing, with chocolate chunks and rice Krispies wound through that are shocking in their verisimilitude, since it also has no added sugars.

But its ubiquity also makes it a target for attackers. In December, security researchers documented a new form of account hijacking called GhostPairing, which sees users tricked into linking an attacker’s browser to their WhatsApp device. Meanwhile, in November, Austrian researchers plugged billions of numbers into WhatsApp’s contact discovery tool to create “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever—along with profile photos and more. WhatsApp is protected by end-to-end encryption, the gold standard of security that, when implemented properly, means only you and the person you’re chatting with can read your messages. Behind the scenes, WhatsApp has also launched passkey-encrypted backups and privacy-enhanced AI technology. But there are a bunch of features you can use to boost your own privacy and security in the Meta-owned app. Here are eight of the best. Privacy Checkup A good place to start is WhatsApp’s Privacy Checkup feature in Settings under Privacy, which allows you to control who sees data such as your profile photo, About information, and status. You can also add extra privacy to your profile by adjusting the last Seen/Online setting to Nobody. From there, you can choose who is able to contact you on WhatsApp by blocking unwanted calls and messages. It’s also possible to specify who can add you to groups, silence unknown callers, and manage your blocked contacts. Disappearing Messages While WhatsApp is protected by end-to-end encryption, your messages can be read if you are compromised by spyware or if someone gains physical access to your device. One way of helping to secure chats against this is disappearing messages, which allows you to set a period of time for texts to stay visible before they are deleted. Messages can be set to disappear after 24 hours, seven days, or 90 days after they’re sent. Disappearing messages can be set for all chats or for specific conversations. To enable the feature as default for new one-to-one chats, go to Settings > Privacy > Default message timer and set the time frame for messages to disappear. Just keep in mind that the feature requires trust—anyone can screenshot a message, so you can’t guarantee that what you’ve sent will be deleted everywhere all the time. Two-Factor Authentication Including a Security PIN WhatsApp needs your phone number when you set up an account, but this can also leave it open to various security and privacy risks. A feature that will protect your WhatsApp account from such threats such is a security PIN. The PIN works as two-factor authentication to protect your chats from prying eyes. Open WhatsApp Settings. Tap Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN. Enter a PIN of your choice and confirm it.","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:20.962617

Here’s How to Curate It,"Reddit is one of the best places on the internet for discussing anything that interests you. From home improvements to existential ponderings to movie reviews, there's a subreddit to suit, whether you need advice and opinions or want to give them out. If you want to actually interact with Reddit posts and create your own, you need a Reddit account, and that comes with a Reddit profile. Anyone else on the platform can look this up to check how long you've been on Reddit, the boards you've active on, and the posts and comments you've contributed. You don't necessarily want all of this information on display to everyone all of the time, and Reddit has now rolled out more customization controls for limiting what shows up on your profile when someone else visits. You can now hide a lot of the post and comment activity, for example, if you don't want it to be directly viewable from your profile. It's worth taking a few minutes to change your profile settings to suit your needs: You never know who might be taking a peek at your Reddit profile, and with these new controls, you can keep your privacy protected. Find the Settings There are new settings for your Reddit profile. David Nield If you've got any Reddit page open in a desktop web browser, you can click your profile avatar (top right), then View Profile to see what you're sharing with the wider world: You'll see headers including Posts, Comments, Upvoted, and Downvoted, which will show your Reddit activity in reverse chronological order.","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:21.503846

Thanks to its revolutionary Pleasure Air Technology that mimics the feeling of oral sex, not only has Womanizer discovered a way to stimulate the 10,000+ nerve endings in the clitoris in a way that hadn’t been done by a sex toy before—yes, they were the first—but the brand can even boast a 100% orgasm rate among users. As a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2, both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance, the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm. But because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you. That’s where Womanizer coupons come into play—because no one should have to decide on just one of their fantastic sex toys.

Pretty much every building lets in a lot of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and vaporous chemicals. Not to mention off-gassing from indoor plastics, furniture, and paint. It’s important to ensure that the air you’re breathing is clean—from stopping coughs and allergy symptoms to helping us wake up with clearer sinuses and less raspy throats—air purifiers can make all the difference. AirDoctor makes a myriad of efficient air purifiers for every type of home, and we have AirDoctor promo codes and deals to help you save big on clean air. Get $400 Off With AirDoctor Coupon With something as serious as the health of your home, it’s important to act now and stay prepared. We know air purifiers can be pricey, and AirDoctor has made it more accessible for all. In preparation for the launch of their newest air purifying system, the AirDoctor 4000, you’ll get an extra $400 off when you pre-order (a total of $400 in savings instead of $800 under regular pricing). Their sleek design has advanced triple filtration and 360-degree air intake that traps 99.99% of particles, like allergens, smoke, mold, and bacteria. Save 15% on AirDoctor Filter Combo Packs We all know buying in bulk is the cheaper option almost always (See Costco, Sam’s Club, et. al), and purifying your home’s air is no different. AirDoctor has a deal right now, where you’ll save 15% when you purchase a filter combo pack (as opposed to individual filters). There’s no promo code required, either, so all you need to do is add it to your cart and you’re golden. What Does an AirDoctor Purifier Do? As mentioned at the top, air purifiers can help clean the air in your home, especially against some of those less-known (or noticed) toxins on top of everyday things like smoke, paint, and pet dander. We know the importance of clean air, and that’s why we’ve set up a handy guide on How to Buy an Air Purifier, including important, but often overlooked points, like how to fit your room to an air purifier and how to best pick out one that will best fit your home’s needs. We also have spent months testing air purifiers, and have rounded up the Best Air Purifiers for your home, including our picks for small or large rooms, and those with built-in fans or heaters. We thought the AirDoctor Smart 5500i was the best purifier for PM 2.5 and gases because it captures fine particulates with its HEPA filters and gases with its dual action/carbon volatile organic compound trap filters, all while exchanging the air four times an hour in a 1,000-square-foot space. The purifier also has a handy alert to let you know when it is time to change the filter. There are tons of different AirDoctor options for various sized rooms, so make sure you read our guides and measure your home before purchasing to ensure you have the best AirDoctor air purifier for your space. Best AirDoctor Air Purifier for Mold and Pets in 2025 As a cat parent living with someone who suffers from cat allergies, I know just how important an air purifier is to keep your home clean. One of the best air purifiers on the market is the AirDoctor 3500, which is great at tackling mold and pet dander. It’s ideal for medium to large rooms like your bedroom, living room, or kitchen. It’s great for rooms with a lot of odors, as it circulates 630 square feet four times per hour to give you continuous clean air, and it also has 3-stage filtration with UltraHEPA.","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:14:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:43:22.634131

That was Donald Trump's message during a press conference held at his Mar-a-Lago compound after US forces launched an offensive against various military targets in Venezuela early Saturday morning. The operation culminated in Maduro's capture. In the briefing, Trump stressed that his administration will not allow someone “that does not have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind” to take control of the country. “We have had decades of that. We are not going to let that happen,” he said. “We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.” Trump explained that the leadership of Venezuela will be in the hands of high-ranking US officials, including secretary of state Marco Rubio and secretary of defense Pete Hegseth. At the same time, María Corina Machado, considered the main leader of the opposition to Maduro and Hugo Chávez and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, issued a statement in which she said that opposition party figure Edmundo González Urrutia must immediately assume the presidency of the country. “This is the time of the citizens. Of those of us who risked everything for democracy on July 28 [2024, the date of the last Venezuelan presidential election]. Of those of us who elected Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimate president of Venezuela, who must immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces by all the officers and soldiers who are part of it. Today we are prepared to enforce our mandate and take power,” the statement says. The text was republished by Gonzalez Urrutia himself, who made a direct appeal to the Venezuelan population: “Venezuelans, these are decisive hours. Know that we are ready for the great operation of reconstruction of our nation.” Trump appears to have other ideas. At Saturday's press conference, he indicated that his administration has plans to rebuild the Venezuelan oil infrastructure and recover the oil that, according to the president, was “stolen” from the United States several decades ago. “Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,” Trump claimed. “We are going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure … and start making money for the country.”","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 22:10:35 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:24.420796

Some people shared old videos across social platforms, falsely claiming that they showed the attacks on the Venezuelan capital Caracas. On TikTok, Instagram, and X, people shared AI-generated images and videos that claimed to show US Drug Enforcement Administration agents and various law enforcement personnel arresting Maduro. In recent years, major global incidents have triggered huge amounts of disinformation on social media as tech companies have pulled back efforts to moderate their platforms. Many accounts have sought to take advantage of these lax rules to boost engagement and gain followers. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in the early hours of Saturday morning. Hours later, US attorney general Pam Bondi announced that Maduro and his wife had been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices. “They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” Bondi wrote on X. Within minutes of the news of Maduro’s arrest breaking, an image claiming to show two DEA agents flanking the Venezuelan president spread widely on multiple platforms. However, using SynthID, a technology developed by Google DeepMind that claims to identify AI-generated images, WIRED was able to confirm it was likely fake. “Based on my analysis, most or all of this image was generated or edited using Google AI,” Google’s Gemini chatbot wrote after anaylzing the image being shared online. “I detected a SynthID watermark, which is an invisible digital signal embedded by Google's AI tools during the creation or editing process. This technology is designed to remain detectable even when images are modified, such as through cropping or compression.” The fake image was first reported by fact-checker David Puente. While X’s AI chatbot Grok also confirmed that the image was fake when asked by several X users, it falsely claimed that the image was an altered version of the arrest of Mexican drug boss Dámaso López Núñez in 2017.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:14:47 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:24.831625

ChatGPT Disagrees,"At around 2 am local time in Caracas, Venezuela, US helicopters flew overhead while explosions resounded below. A few hours later, US president Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife had been “captured and flown out of the Country.” US attorney general Pam Bondi followed with a post on X that Maduro and his wife had been indicted in the Southern District of New York and would “soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” It has been a stunning series of events, with unknown repercussions for the global world order. If you asked ChatGPT about it this morning, it told you that you’re making it up. WIRED asked leading chatbots ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini the same question a little before 9 am ET. In all cases, we used the free, default version of the service, since that’s what the majority of users experience. We also asked AI search platform Perplexity, which advertises “accurate, trusted, and real-time answers to any question.” (While Perplexity Pro users have access to a wide range of third-party AI models, the default, free search experience routes users to different models based on a variety of factors.) The question was: Why did the United States invade Venezuela and capture its leader Nicolás Maduro? The responses were decidedly mixed. Credit to Anthropic and Google, whose respective Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 3 models gave timely responses. Gemini confirmed that the attack had taken place, gave context around the US claims of “narcoterrorism” and US military buildup in the region prior to the attack, and acknowledged the Venezuela government’s position that all of this is pretext for accessing Venezuela’s significant oil and mineral reserves. It cited 15 sources along the way, ranging from Wikipedia to The Guardian to the Council on Foreign Relations. Claude initially balked. “I don't have any information about the United States invading Venezuela or capturing Nicolás Maduro. This hasn't happened as of my knowledge cutoff in January 2025,” it responded. It then took an important next step: “Let me search for current information about Venezuela and Maduro to see if there have been any recent developments.” The chatbot then listed 10 news sources—including NBC News but also Breitbart—and gave a brisk four-paragraph summary of the morning’s events, providing a link to a new source after nearly every sentence.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:03:15 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:25.266281

To put things in perspective, the extremely high-end Razer Blade 16 with the RTX 5070 is around $2,300 (though it frequently dips on sale below $2,000). With the Framework Laptop 16, you're paying extra for the ability to swap out parts in the future. Game 2560 x 1600 1920 x 1200 Cyberpunk 2077 56 fps 93 fps Black Myth: Wukong 27 fps 37 fps Marvel Rivals 40 fps 56 fps Monster Hunter Wilds 46 fps 60 fps Fortunately, what you get in return is solid gaming performance. It's good enough to give you an option of playing in native resolution in some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077. The frame rates you see above were all tested at the highest graphics preset without enabling upscaling or ray tracing, so you can get higher frame rates by dropping the settings. I like that there's enough performance to let gamers choose smoother gameplay or sharper visuals depending on the game and the style of play. Of the games I tested, Black Myth: Wukong was the only title that couldn't run smoothly at the max graphics settings. The RTX 5070 only has 8 GB of VRAM, which is its biggest deficiency in AAA titles, unlike the desktop GPU of the same name, which has 12 GB. The trade-off in adding a discrete graphics card is in battery life, though it's not as bad as you might think. Despite having just as powerful graphics, the Framework Laptop 16 still nets around 25 percent more battery life than the cheaper gaming laptops out there. In my testing, it lasted for close to nine hours in local video playback. That will equate to much less in a real-life workload—I was getting closer to five hours in my typical daily work. One unique benefit of the system is that you can always remove the graphics module if you want to get a few more hours of battery life while traveling, and you don't plan to play games. One of the impressive things about the Framework Laptop 16 is that it runs entirely off USB-C power. The 240-watt GaN power charger is no bigger than a standard charger, yet it can power the entire system, graphics included. Just make sure to actually use both sides of the included charger to get the full performance. The Framework laptops were conceived and designed before the recent changes in laptop pricing. You can now buy a really great laptop for $650—even less during big sales events. Unfortunately, Framework's pricing doesn't tend to change, and the company doesn't sell through third-party retailers. But there's an audience for a repairable, sustainable, and now more powerful laptop—whether you want it to run Linux or Windows. Just be ready to pay a premium.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:25.714502

We're still typing with our fingers, like cave people, instead of talking out loud the way the future was supposed to be. Have you ever seen Picard touch a keyboard? Of course not. And it's odd because our computers are all capable of turning speech into text by default. The problem? It just doesn't work very well. Or, at least, it didn't. In recent years AI models like Nvidia's Parakeet and OpenAI's Whisper, both open source, have made great strides in turning human voices into text. Both excel at correctly adding things like punctuation and capitalization, and you can run them right on your computer. Using these models is the closest I've felt to recording a captain's log—it just works. The problem? They're both a little complicated to set up. That's where Handy comes in. This is a dead-simple, totally free application that can set up either of these models on your computer and give you a keyboard shortcut to use it. It was created by CJ Pais after he broke his finger, rendering him unable to type. He wanted a totally free, and radically simple, way to use existing AI speech-to-text tools.

57,57.0,57.0,57.0,57.0,107.0,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/oura-whoop-blood-labs/,Blood Feud: Oura’s Health Panels Versus Whoop’s Advanced Labs,"Hey, Theranos? Ever heard of it? Erstwhile founder and current felon Elizabeth Holmes may have drastically overstated her claims by saying you could take a bunch of affordable health tests with one drop of blood, but the company was trying to address a real problem. Many people get a panel of blood tests as part of their routine wellness check, and they’re not fun at all. Blood tests are inconvenient to schedule. You have to fast for at least eight hours beforehand for many of them, and it’s hell if you’re scared of needles. This year, fitness tracker companies like Oura and Whoop began offering blood panels as part of their subscription services, albeit with an additional surcharge. Ultrahuman also offers a blood panel called Blood Vision, which we have not yet tested because the Ultrahuman ring is no longer sold in the United States. It’s also worth noting that both of these tests are available only in the United States as of the time of this writing and exclude Arizona, Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, which have stricter laws restricting direct access testing without a physician’s order. I booked through the respective apps, starved myself (OK, didn’t eat or drink caffeine for eight hours) for multiple test dates, and had my blood drawn for 11 total vials at the same Quest Diagnostics, where the technicians probably decided I had some weird Twilight fetish. (Disclosure: Both Oura and Whoop covered the out-of-pocket cost for me, and both the devices and the tests are HSA- and FSA-eligible.) I compared these labs to others I had done with my doctor. Here’s what I discovered. Print It Out The first thing you’ll notice when you take a consumer blood panel instead of through your doctor is that, well, you have to book the tests through that company's app. Both Oura and Whoop bill this as a more convenient feature, but if you already have a primary care doctor, it's not. (I realize that having a primary care doctor in this country is already a fairly big hurdle.) My doctor orders labs for my annual exam; I just walk down the hall and get them done as part of my yearly checkup. I booked my Health Panels test through Oura, but after not eating all morning and waiting for 15 minutes in a small, grim room in the back of a Safeway, the lab technician told me she could not find my lab order. I suggest downloading your lab order from the company as a PDF, printing it out, and bringing that hard copy to your appointment. For my yearly checkup, given my general state of health, my primary care doctor ordered a basic blood panel with three tests comprising 20 biomarkers—that’s a complete blood count, A1C to check for diabetes, and a lipid profile, which includes your cholesterol levels and indicates your future likelihood of heart disease. Oura’s test cost $99, and the comprehensive panel measures 50 biomarkers—more than twice what my doctor ordered. In addition to the lipid panels, blood count, and A1C, it includes other panels like blood glucose, insulin, potassium, sodium, total protein, and triglycerides. These results took longer to come back than I expected. The first set of results came in after 24 hours, but it took almost two weeks to get my full results and doctor-interpreted report. While most of my results were optimal, there was an alarming one: My blood test for lipoprotein (a) came back at 214 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). (The normal range is <30 nmol/L.) This indicates a seriously elevated inherited genetic risk for cardiovascular disease, like heart attacks or stroke, that is largely not affected by diet, exercise, or lifestyle. Add It Up Whoop’s test, in comparison, starts at $349 for two per year, and unlike with Oura, you can upload tests done through your doctor’s office to the Whoop app for free. Whoop’s Advanced Labs costs more because it offers 65 biomarkers instead of 50, and some of these tests are extremely expensive, like a vitamin D test and various hormone tests. Again, most of my results, even the hormone ones, came back as being optimal. Whoop did catch a few items that Oura missed, like being very low in iron and vitamin D. That's an easy, actionable fix with a daily multivitamin, and I'm glad Whoop caught it.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:09:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:26.664104

Having previously hidden away a lot of the local storage structure, Android and iOS now both give you easy access to it so you can manage your files similar to how you would on Windows or macOS. It reflects a few gradual changes in the phones that we carry around with us, including increasing amounts of onboard storage space, increasingly complex apps, and increasingly sophisticated operating systems. Links with cloud storage platforms are also now more common than ever, which adds to the need for local file management tools. While there are several file managers to use, particularly on Android, we're going to focus on the tools that come built into Android and iOS, and what you can do with them. Besides giving you a better idea of what files you've got and where they are, these apps will also help you free up space on your devices. Files on Android Files on Android lets you browse folders in a number of ways. David Nield If you own an Android phone of some description, you'll find the Files app from Google is preinstalled. Open the app and you should see recently saved files first, then different file categories that you can browse through, including Downloads, Images, Videos, and Documents. You can also search for files using the box at the top. Farther down the screen, you can access every folder on your file via the Internal storage button and every cloud storage account you've connected to Android via the Other storage button. There's also access to your Safe folder here, which is a special folder you can protect with a PIN and use to store particularly sensitive files. Once you're within a specific folder or file category, you're able to tap on any file to open it—for formats that cannot be opened within the Files app itself, you'll be prompted to choose a different app on your phone to handle it. Tap the grid or list icon in the top right corner to change the folder view, and the three dots (also top right), then Sort by to change the order in which files are shown. New folders can be added from the same menu.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:27.111591

But if you've got the itch to travel, I recommend iFit, which partners with NordicTrack, ProForm, and FreeMotion equipment. You get world-class athletic instructors with jaw-dropping natural scenery from all over the world for workouts that are both stunning and entertaining. I may not be able to ride a pump track with Ashleigh McIvor in real life, but on iFit's platform, I laughed out loud from the exhilaration of flying behind her as the bike tilted up and down. I loved it so much, in fact, that my own mother bought the treadmill and has been enjoying her own global walks at home. Zombies, Run!: If you've ever thought to yourself, ""The only way I'd start running is if I had to flee for my life,"" you can now start practicing. Zombies, Run! is an award-winning audio survival game that's secretly a fitness tool. Once you connect your headphones and start your workout, an audio guide narrates your fitness journey. In an apocalyptic, zombified world, it's your job to scavenge resources for your ragtag band of human survivors and evade death. The app is free, but you can pay for the Abel Runner’s Club version to access all eight seasons and features. In addition to heart-pounding audio storylines and narrated adventures, there are also virtual races, stat tracking, GPS-enabled maps, and the ability to connect with your Apple Watch or Google Pixel Watch. I have no doubt it's effective—I burned at least 5 to 10 calories just listening in fear to the YouTube trailer. Smash Your Fitness: If you're a cyclist, you probably have a trainer set up for what WIRED writer Robbie Gonzalez once called ""human hamster-wheeling.” If you find Zwift boring, you might want to consider a new cycling game called Smash Your Fitness. Cyclists strap on a Smashometer, a small, rechargeable ankle device that transmits leg speed to the game via Bluetooth or directly to your smart trainer via Bluetooth or ANT+. You cycle through a sci-fi universe that feels like you're suspended in space, while riding on a track akin to a revolving strand of DNA or a natural world that’s a compelling virtual facsimile of Europe or the Southwest. You can pedal with friends remotely or join paced group rides led by virtual ride leaders. A hunky AI coach can also spit out a workout program after you feed him some basic data. Premade workouts can be as short as five minutes or as long as several hours. There are a lot of moving parts with Smash that a cyclist like me who just wants to get some quick exercise might not want or need. For example, cyclists have the option to “steer” the bike using their phone or keyboard. When this feature is turned on, there’s a risk of crashing, which I did at least 10 times in one ride. Throughout a month of testing, I found that the app isn't quite easy to use. I never could sync it with my Zwift Hub smart trainer. The company promises that connectivity bugs will soon be worked out, but until then it’s up to the Smashometer to carry the ride. Also, the companion app is still waiting for approval from Apple and the Google Play Store. —Steph Pearson Courtesy of Yoqi Yoqi: Qigong is the ancient Chinese practice of using breath control and body movements to gather life energy (known as qi) and redistribute it around your body and back into the earth. It's also a great way to start your day on an energetic note. Qigong exercises are done in a standing posture, and the gentle activities slot somewhere between tai chi movements and your favorite standing yoga poses. I picked up a daily qigong practice thanks to a series of videos by Marisa Cranfill of Yoqi.com. Her company's name says it all: Cranfill designs routines that are a combination of yoga and qigong, with equal emphasis on breathing, balance, meditation, and Chinese medicine. Also, the integration of yoga elements makes for an easier onboarding experience for those who are well-versed in yoga but new to qigong. There are a bunch of free videos on Yoqi's YouTube channel, including a 30-minute video for first-timers. Start there. Once you're up to speed, a $15 subscription earns you unlimited video views on the company's website. Cranfill also has some fun audio meditations you can download for $15 to $30 each. —Michael Calore Yoga With Kassandra: My personal favorite online yogi is Yoga With Adriene's Adriene Mishler, and not just because we have the same name and own the same breed of dog. But in WIRED's offices, I'm outnumbered by fans of Yoga with Kassandra. It all comes down to personal taste—I'd say Adriene is more chatty and casual, and Kassandra more efficient and business-like. There are plenty of online yoga instructors to try if neither personality quite gels with you. If Adriene cooing that a pose is ""yummy"" makes you cringe, you can also give Jessamyn Stanley or Yoga with Tim a shot. I also enjoy Cosmic Kids Yoga with my children on weekend afternoons. For more tips, check out our story on Everything You Need for Your Yoga Practice. Dance Church: If you miss walking into a club, getting your heart pumping, and thrashing your arms wildly around with a bunch of sweaty, ecstatic strangers, then Dance Church might be for you. The online platform offers crazy dance sessions led by real-life dancers, with a variety of bodies, dance styles, and (I have to say it) wonderful apparel. The company does lead live classes in-person that are pay-as-you-go, but a $19 per month on-demand subscription gets you continuous access to both live and on-demand dance sessions. This is a good option if you're fitting in exercise sessions with small children who think it's the height of both fitness and entertainment to jump up and down on the couch beside you.

Days later, Apple and Google patched security holes that experts think were used to plant the stealthy malware on a select group of devices. Spyware is so dangerous because the adversary is able to see and hear everything you do on your smartphone, including via encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. But it tends to be extremely targeted against dissidents, journalists, politicians, and business leaders operating in certain sectors. The malware has hit a number of high-profile people, including former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Hanan Elatr, wife of murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi—who were both compromised by NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Today, spyware remains just as prolific in these circles, but experts think its impact could be widening. In early December, as Google issued its threat notification, the tech firm’s researchers detailed how an exploit chain was used to install Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device. It came after an alert issued by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), warning users that adversaries are “actively leveraging” commercial spyware to target mobile messaging applications. As the risk increases, what can you do to protect your Android device or Apple iPhone? Zero-Click Attacks Spyware often hits smartphones in so-called zero-click attacks, meaning your phone can become infected without clicking a link, downloading a malicious image, or any other kind of user interaction. The attack cannot be mitigated via the usual routes. If the malware has infected your smartphone, adversaries can “read messages, observe keystrokes, take screenshots, monitor notifications, and access banking apps,” according to Pieter Arntz, a senior malware researcher at security firm Malwarebytes. With full system access, spyware can “exfiltrate data such as emails and texts, send messages, steal credentials, and log in to cloud systems,” says Rocky Cole, cofounder of iVerify, an app that helps users to detect spyware. Aside from zero-click attacks, spyware can infect a device when someone clicks on a compromised link sent over text, email, or social media. Meanwhile, the malware can hide in malicious apps that appear to be legit. It can also be concealed in an image file and downloaded via a message, or get onto your smartphone due to vulnerabilities in your browser.","Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:28.188796

It's our upgrade pick for all the extra features it offers compared to other password managers. 1Password has apps that work just about everywhere, including on macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS. There are plug-ins for your favorite web browser too, which makes it easy to generate and edit new passwords on the fly. What Are the Benefits of 1Password? There are also some very nice features in 1Password that you won't find elsewhere. If you frequently travel across national borders, you’ll appreciate Travel Mode. This mode lets you delete any sensitive data from your devices before you travel and then restore it with a click after you’ve crossed a border. This prevents anyone, including law enforcement at international borders, from accessing your complete password vault. In addition to being a password manager, 1Password can act as an authentication app like Google Authenticator, and for added security it creates a secret key to the encryption key it uses, meaning no one can decrypt your passwords without that key. 1Password also offers tight integration with other mobile apps. Rather than needing to copy and paste passwords from your password manager to other apps (which puts your password on the clipboard at least for a moment), 1Password is integrated with many apps and can autofill. This is more noticeable on iOS, where inter-app communication is more restricted. You can get savings on the company’s suite of products with our 1Password coupons and deals. How Much Is a 1Password Password Manager Plan? The price of a 1Password Password manager plan varies by plan, with the annual plan discounted up to 28% off for committing yearly. The plans vary, with an individual plan at $3 per month, family plan at $5 per month, the Teams starter pack (with up to 10 users a month) at $20 per month, and business at $8 per month per user. If you don’t want to commit to a yearly plan—and score massive savings—those plans are a bit more expensive. Monthly individual plans are $4 per month, family is $7 per month, Teams starter pack (with up to 10 users a month) is $25 per month, and business is $10 per month, per user. Best Password Manager 1Password just may be the best password manager. We named it the “best upgrade,” because of its impressive and comprehensive suite of additional security features, like Secret Key and secure travel mode. There are tons of features included that are similar to Bitwarden, Dashlane, Lastpass, NordPass, RoboForm, Enpass, KeePass, and YubiKey. But unlike others, 1Password password manager includes additional security features like a Secret Key for additional protection and a more secure travel mode. We also love 1Password's intuitive interface which makes it simple for families to choose and share logins across devices. Enjoy a 14-Day 1Password Free Trial Not sure if 1Password is right for you? Try it free for 14 days! No credit card required, you get full access to premium features and cancel anytime.

Carrying several types of phones, tablets, keyboards, and other tech gear, OnePlus uses an Android-based operating system, is universally unblocked and works with all US carriers. We know how important your tech purchases are (duh, we’re WIRED) and we have a OnePlus promo code to help you save. Offers Now Available for OnePlus 15 and OnePlus 13 The anticipated OnePlus 15 has launched with new buzz-worthy features and improvements on the already-polished tech from techy fan favorite, OnePlus. It’s true what they say: the early bird gets the worm. When you subscribe today for OnePlus newsletters and information about the latest drops, you can get $50 off or a chance to win the OnePlus Pad 3 for free. And, if you decide on the OnePlus 13 instead, you can get a Black Eclipse12 GB RAM with 256 GB ROM for $900, and get a free gift with purchase. OnePlus Phone: OnePlus 12 Now Available As mentioned, we at WIRED love OnePlus because of the affordable price point while maintaining solid quality. The newest iteration of the OnePlus 12 impressed us. One of the biggest drawbacks in previous models was the camera quality, but OnePlus has done a lot of work to improve it in the past few years and it’s now on level with competitors like Samsung. Our senior reviews editor and tech overlord Julian Chokkattu called the newest iteration a “Very Good Phone” (high praise from him). It also charges with blazing speed. We also made a bold statement about the OnePlus Pad, whose existence we (perhaps polarizing) said “proves that Android tablets don’t have to suck”—and still think it’s a worthy iPad alternative, especially at a fair price point in the $400 range. Plus, we love their fun folding phone, the OnePlus Open, and recommend the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro if you’re a huge computer nerd. OnePlus Promo: 30% Off OnePlus Buds 4 Looking to upgrade your sound experience for less? The OnePlus Buds 4 are a great choice for most people, with 11mm audio drivers for balanced, true-to-life acoustics for an unmatched sound. The high-resolution audio features LHDC 5.0 technology and Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity for super sound quality. Plus, they feature active noise cancellation so you can tune out the world and focus on what matters most to you. The Buds 4 have even more smart features, like adaptive mode which switches between ANC and transparency modes, and an ergonomic, comfortable in-ear design.

You’ll get 15% off select products such as phones, earbuds, tablets, and more. (The student discount cannot be combined with additional discounts.)

Tesla has lost the title of the world’s largest maker of EVs to Chinese automaker BYD. The signs have been there for a while, with BYD besting Tesla sales in Europe a number of times during 2025. Now it’s official on a global basis. Despite being blocked from entering the US market, BYD’s seemingly unstoppable rise continues as its EV sales rose last year by 28 percent to 2.25 million. In contrast, Tesla announced today it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025—its second annual decline in a row, and a 16 percent year-over-year decline for the fourth quarter. This is not merely the China brand edging ahead of Tesla in the electric vehicle race; it's a marked shift. Last week, BYD stated that in 2025 it sold 4.6 million “new energy vehicles” (which includes both full EVs and plug-in hybrids) globally, with more than a million of these being exported cars. Its passenger vehicle exports specifically were up more than 145 percent year-on-year. The news comes after a frankly disastrous year for Tesla that saw the high-selling Model Y, crucial for both Elon Musk and his car company, get a half-hearted refresh that bombed, failing to reverse sales woes. It was also a year that disclosed just how few people bought the much-berated Cybertruck; in March, yet another recall revealed the company had apparently sold less than 50,000 electric pickups since customer deliveries began 14 months previously. Musk had told investors Tesla would sell 250,000 Cybertrucks per year. With Tesla sales down in the US and in free fall in Europe, Musk turned to US president Donald Trump for help. Trump obliged by morphing the White House South Lawn into a makeshift Tesla showroom, claiming he would himself purchase a racy Model S Plaid. But by June it was reported Trump might be selling the car after publicly falling out with Musk. Just last month, EV news site Electrek reported that Musk’s SpaceX had bought tens of millions of dollars worth of Cybertrucks that supposedly Tesla can’t sell. (You can see the pickups all lined up at SpaceX in this video.) If true, that move would significantly bolster Tesla’s financial performance in 2025's fourth quarter, providing at least some respite for the automaker after the US ended its EV tax credits at the end of the third quarter. “Tesla still has formidable assets, brand recognition, manufacturing know-how, and a strong installed base,” says Andy Palmer, former COO of Nissan and former CEO of Aston Martin Lagonda. “The challenge is that the market has matured while the product line has not moved fast enough. People are struggling to justify spending on a Tesla when other brands, including those from China, are delivering more innovative and advanced products.”","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:54:34 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:31.915022

Here are a few of the other shoes we've tested that you might want to consider if the above do not work for your foot. If you're not familiar with a brand, we recommend going to a local running store for a test run before plunking down your credit card. Diadora Nucleo 2 for $165: The Nucleo 2 isn’t a wow, high-energy, super springy shoe. But if you’re a fan of straightforward, no nonsense comfort and good inherent stability across a good range of paces, the Nucleo 2 delivers. Rad R1 for $160: Made to master gym, HIIT, running and all manner of hybrid workouts, I’ve been using the Rad R1 when I’m eating up my strength and condition work in the gym like a good boy. They’re good for short runs, and miles on the softer treadmill belt, stable and supportive enough to get under the bar and offer control for drills like box jumps and lunges. They look good too. Altra Outroad 3 for $130: Altra is a smaller brand that's known for its wide toe box and zero heel-to-toe drop—it makes shoes that feel like you're running barefoot, but offer more protection. This is my favorite shoe for switching between roads and trails. They're affordable, too.—Adrienne So New Balance Rebel V5 for $145, Adidas EVO SL for $120, Mizuno Neo Vista 2 for $200: Another top-notch all rounder to rival the Saucony Endorphin Speed 5, the Rebel V5 is smooth, light and capable across the whole pace range. The Adidas EVO SL can also handle anything you throw at it. But if you like your things super soft with a bit of bounce, the Mizuno Neo Vista 2 serves up a uniquely cushioned plush ride. New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v14 for $165, HOKA Clifton 9 for $144: If you've never run before, the Hoka Clifton 9 is my recommendation for a beginning runner. Despite Hoka's outsized (ahem) reputation, this is a pretty minimal shoe that's comfortable, balanced, and light.—Adrienne So Saucony Ride 17 for $99: This is also a good older budget-shoe model. Saucony Hurricane 24 for $110, Brooks Glycerin 21 GTS for $160: Consumer tech director and podcast host Michael Calore runs in the Brooks Glycerin. This is our alternative pick if you're shopping for shoes that offer greater stability. FAQ How Should I Care for My Running Shoes? Give them a rest day.

Prolonged exposure to high heat from a radiator or the sun’s rays can dry, harden, and damage the midsole. Stuff them. Remove the insoles and dry each running shoe separately. Then use scrunched up newspaper to dry out damp inners faster and help the uppers retain their shape. How Long Should My Shoes Last? The internet's collective wisdom says that you should replace your shoes somewhere between 300 and 500 miles. However, this decades-old rule of thumb is based on a few limited studies and general advice from brands. New foam varieties, outsole rubbers, and upper technology means it’s now harder to offer blanket advice. There are many formulas of modern midsole foams. Durability is now judged not only by how long the protective cushioning lasts, but also whether it continues to deliver the bounce and performance. Some of the top superfoams might lose their initial energy but remain as protective as a firmer, more traditional EVA sole. For example, your high-tech carbon race shoe could become your daily runner once it’s lost its top-speed edge. You also have to factor in your unique running style. Shoes wear differently for different runners, impacted by variables like weight, stride pattern, pace, daily usage, terrain, and climate. There are obvious signs of wear and tear: Heel collars rubbed through, holes in the uppers or grip worn to the point it’s no longer effective. It’s harder to spot when a midsole has had its day. They don’t crease in the same way older shoes used to. The best advice: Use your shoes until something feels off. When that happens, you might want to start shopping.

70,70.0,70.0,70.0,70.0,120.0,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/welcome-to-the-future-of-noise-canceling/,Welcome to the Future of Noise Canceling,"This blurring of the lines between audio and health devices looks set to be a trend across the industry. “We really want to make sure that we take care of our customers’ hearing,” says Miikka Tikander, the Helsinki-based head of audio at Bang & Olufsen. Tikander points to recent data about the decline in hearing health in young adults and reports that there was a lot of emphasis from manufacturers on ANC and hearing health at the AES’ Headphone Technology conference in Espoo, Finland this August. “Apple has a big lead in that area,” he says. “We want to make sure that our headphones can adapt, make this choice [on when to block out sound] on your behalf, if you let it, of course. Some people don't like that idea, but if there's a noisy event in your surroundings, the headset can take care of it, just tune it out a bit and get you back to normal listening once you are away from that noise.” Enter the “Sound Bubble” Hearvana AI is one startup looking to go much further than the AirPods’ current suite of noise canceling and ambient noise features. Cofounded by Shyam Gollakota, a computer science & engineering professor at the University of Washington, and two of his students, Malek Itani and Tuochao Chen, Hearvana recently raised $6 million in a pre-seed round which included none other than Amazon’s Alexa Fund. One of the startup’s first big innovations was “semantic hearing,” which was the first project they approached, around three years ago. The team built a hardware prototype—a pair of on-ear headphones with six microphones across the headband, connected to an Orange Pi microcontroller—to test out a model that had been trained to recognize 20 different types of ambient sounds. This included things like sirens, car horns, birdsong, crying babies, alarm clocks, pets, and people talking, and then allowed the user to isolate say, one person’s voice as a “spotlight,” and block out all the other frequencies. “So I'm going to the beach and I want to listen to just ocean sounds and not the people talking next to me, or I’m in the house vacuum cleaning but I still want to listen to people knocking on the door or important sounds, like a baby crying,” explains Gollakota, who is based in Seattle. “And that’s what we solved first. This was the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a door knock. They sound pretty different, right?”","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:33.148402
71,71.0,71.0,71.0,71.0,121.0,,wired,https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-meal-kit-services-1/,"10 Best Meal Delivery Services, Tested by an Ex-Restaurant Critic","Frequently Asked Questions Are Meal Delivery Services Worth It? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron If you're talking raw materials by the pound—meat, zucchini, rice, noodles—meal kits will of course cost more than buying food at grocery stores. It's a service, after all, with added value above simple ingredient cost. Unless you've got quite expensive taste, you'll easily be able to make delicious meals at home for less than the $7 to $14 a serving that a meal kit will cost. But this said, this doesn't necessarily mean that meal kits are expensive for what they offer. I conducted an experiment, trying to re-create four different meal-kit meals by going to my local grocery store—buying every ingredient provided by the meal kit. Turns out, if you don't have the right sauces and spices at home already, it's very difficult to recreate these tasty meals at grocery stores for less than they cost from a meal kit, in part because you'll most likely have to buy full containers of sauces and spice instead of pre-portioned ingredients, So, is HelloFresh worth it compared to a grocery store? Caveats are in order: For staple ingredients and spices you'll use on multiple recipes, the grocery store is of course cheaper. Once you buy a container of paprika for an individual recipe, it'll also be there for future recipes, whereas meal-kit spices are portioned for the meal. So the real answer is that meal kits can be a quite economical way of trying out a new recipe, or a new style of cooking, without larding up your fridge with condiments you won't use again. For ingredients you'd use less commonly, a meal kit can reduce waste and spoilage, and maybe even compete on price for an individual meal. If your comparison point is takeout, well, the best meal delivery services on this list will almost certainly be cheaper and more nutritious. I've found that a meal kit in the fridge tends to be a good motivator to cook a nutritive meal—and thus can save me both the money and the cholesterol. To really save on cost, some people like to keep testing out the trial offers and discounts. Much like mattress-in-a-box companies, meal-kit companies usually have a running promotion. Usually this takes the form of a trial discount price that'll drop your cost by half or more on the first box, in hopes you'll like the service enough to keep it on at full price. For me, a meal kit a few times a week ends up balancing out well: It's a motivating factor to eat better, and it means that when I do go to the grocery store, I can do so less mindlessly and more purposefully, since I've always got a few meals' worth of ingredients in the fridge. It's also had the side effect of broadening my culinary toolkit, keeping me from getting stuck in the same ruts. That said, you know: It's a set grocery expense and not necessarily a small one. I do get tired of tossing or recycling cold packs and boxes. And depending on time of year, I often prefer shopping in person for what's seasonal and local, when produce is at its peak—an experience you don't get from a meal kit, or from grocery delivery for that matter. If you're cooking for a bigger household, meal kits can also lose their utility quite quickly. A convenient option for two can become a much larger expense for a family of four or six. What If I Take a Trip Out of Town? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Pretty much every meal kit I've tested has an option to pause subscriptions—and there's no particular limit to how often you can do this. The main thing is to be sure that you've canceled with enough lead time. Some services let you cancel or pause delivery as late as the Friday before a Monday delivery. HelloFresh requires five days' notice. Some, like Hungryroot, may lock in next week's order as early as the previous Monday, depending on where you live. Read your terms of service, and act accordingly. How to Optimize Meal Kits AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Don't order too many meals per week: You know the old John Lennon line: Life is what happens when you're busy out eating a random burrito, then thinking guiltily about the meal kit at home in your fridge. Aspirations are great, but don't order more meals than you're likely to make, or you'll be sad. Err on the side of caution. Order just enough meals per week that making yourself a recipe from your HelloFresh or Home Chef box is still a delight and a convenience and an overall boon to your life—not an obligation. For me, a somewhat improvisational and impulsive person, three meals a week is the sweet spot. The prospect of a few easy meals usually saves me from an impulse weeknight DoorDash."" Make room in your fridge: Meal kits take the place of a lot of grocery shopping. But they're also a lot of food, and a lot to keep organized. What I like to do is clear a tall enough space in my fridge to put the whole meal kit box in the fridge, after pulling out the cold packs: This way, I'm not left worrying about which groceries belong to the meal kit, and I won't lose any ingredients. I can just pull the whole box out when I want to make a meal. That said, some plans like Home Chef, HelloFresh, and Green Chef are very good at organizing each meal into its own separate bag. An added bonus from these more organized plans is that you'll be able to use less space in your fridge. Over time, this will matter. Check the recipe cards to make sure you have everything you need to make a recipe: Most meal kits expect that you'll have certain staple ingredients in your home, usually including oil and butter. Recipes also have requirements for cookware. Check this before you start a recipe. Nothing worse than realizing you need an absentee stick of butter on step 5, with carrots already browning in the toaster oven. Remember, you owe nothing to the recipe: Meal kit services hire lovely recipe developers, of course. And on the best meal kits, these chefs have spent a lot of time optimizing each recipe. But you owe them nothing—nothing! Add spices, change steps, season food when you want to season it. Meal kits can teach you a lot about how to make a good meal, and shake you out of tired culinary routines. But it's your meal. Make it how you like. Have fun. How Do We Test Meal Kits? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Chances are, wherever you are, whatever week it is, I'm testing a meal kit right now. I constantly cycle among various meal kits, testing and retesting each of my top picks at least once a year—and often multiple times per year. I order at least four meals from each when possible, and prepare meals according to instructions and see how well it goes. I check my own prep times against the advertised prep times (rarely an exercise in honesty!), and take note of any inconsistencies, vagueness, or frustration in the recipe card instructions. If you needlessly recommend a nonstick pan, I like you less, especially if you tell me I should heat said pan before adding food—or you later make mention of browned fond in the recipe. Nonstick isn't cast iron or carbon, there's no fond. I check for the quality and freshness of the produce, and do the same for the meat. Where possible, I also look into where the meat was sourced, and check on the reputation, safety, and standards of the meat suppliers. If a meal kit swears it's gluten-free, I check on this—calling certifying organizations where relevant. I usually try to order as varied a menu a possible, checking in on gluten-free meals, a seafood item, a vegetarian item, and white and dark meat item—as well as meals that draw (or attempt to draw) from onspirations all over the globe. Sometimes, I test the same meal kit multiple times for different dietary needs, and our vegan tester, Molly Higgins, often tests the same meal kit I do but with a different focus. More Meal Kits We Liked Sunbasket Chicken and Greek Orzo Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Sunbasket (~$14 per serving): Sunbasket is a plan that focuses heavily on fresh, organic ingredients, and offers a whole lot of variety and good cooking techniques, including deglazing and attentiveness to saucing. And like Hungryroot, it also offers breakfasts and snacks to supplement meal options with little extras like coconut yogurt and sous-vide egg bites. The meal kit also lets you filter out allergen-containing items. My colleague Louryn Strampe loved the flexibility and add-ons (and even some crickets!) On my most recent test, I enjoyed in particular an excellent Greek chicken and orzo salad dish—and wonder of wonders, the advertised prep time was actually the actual prep time (about 30 minutes). The focus on organic ingredients does make Sunbasket one of the more expensive meal kit options. The annual Thankgiving meal kit is a lovely and welcome extravagance at $200, and can be ordered until 8 days before Thanksgiving. Dinnerly Meal Kit Photograph: Matthew Korfhage; Getty Images Dinnerly ($6 to $9 per serving): Marley Spoon's lower-cost meal kit, Dinnerly was long WIRED's budget pick. Frankly, it's still a good affordable pick. It's also a stolidly meat-and-potatoes pick, and often straightforwardly Midwestern in its recipes. The proteins are generous and of excellent quality, and the produce is fresh. The meals are balanced. But the recipe development and instructions weren't quite up to Marley Spoon standards on my most recent test of the kit, though I did love the middle-American trashiness and hold-my-beer inventiveness of a “Reuben meatloaf” stuffed with sauerkraut and caraway seeds. This year I ended up preferring the meals I tried from EveryPlate, which has the further merit of being a buck cheaper a meal. Factor (~$14 a serving): Factor is a prepared meal delivery plan run by HelloFresh, with ready-to-eat meals that look a lot like TV dinners. But there's a twist: They've never been frozen. They were made fresh in a commissary kitchen, and shipped out with cold packs. It's kinda like restaurant leftovers. This means that proteins in particular often maintain their texture quite well, including a chimichurri filet mignon I couldn't believe I microwaved. Some meals, especially carb-avoidant or keto meals, are oddly mushy. But meals centered on proteins and whole starches like potatoes or rice, alongside veggies like green beans or brussels sprouts, tended to fare quite well. So did stir-fry-style meals. In fact, a recent test of Factor's high protein plan was my favorite experience with the meal kit, and included wild rice and excellent pork loin. I do wish they'd shed their reliance on the microwave, however: When I went off-script and used a toaster oven or the Ninja Crispi air fryer, I had much better results than with the nuker. Like many ready-to-eat meals, it's a bit more expensive than the kits you cook yourself. Fuel Meals Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Fuel Meals ($13 to $14 a serving): Fuel Meals are not the cheapest option among meal delivery that arrives frozen; it's about the same price as never-frozen meals from Factor and CookUnity. But I found that Fuel fulfills a specific niche as well as any prepared meal plans I found. It excels at no-nonsense, no-fluff, no-added-ingredients, pure-protein-packed nutritive meals. Some of Fuel's meals had as few as five ingredients, consisting of essentially the macro nutrients themselves plus a modicum of oil and salt. A large percentage of meals are marked gluten-free or dairy-free. Does all this mean less flavor? It can. The meals are also often not beautiful, dominated by a large and no-nonsense serving of protein. But Fuel's meal service offers an admirable focus, especially for those bulking up or watching carbs. Meals are substantive, usually topping 600 calories and 40 grams of protein without added sugar or fatty dairy or carb-heavy filler. I feel like if I wore tank tops more often, this is what I'd eat. Wildgrain Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Wildgrain ($13 to $17 per loaf or box of pastries): This is less a meal than a way to step up a home meal. Wildgrain is a monthly delivery bread box: You receive par-baked bread and pastries baked at small bakeries all over the country. This is pretty much the same process that likely happens at local restaurants, when your warm bread basket comes out: It's not quite as high-quality as you'd get direct from an artisan bakery, if you live in places with artisan bakeries. But it's also as fresh as it gets, and I had a very good experience testing the box in October 2025, in particular, with sourdough breads perfect for large meals with houseguests. You finish the baking at home, so what you have at the end is ultra-fresh baked bread, biscuits, doughnuts, or scones that are still warm and crisp from the oven. A Wildgrain subscription arrives as a monthly box, filled with four, six, or 12 items that might range from a full sourdough loaf or fresh-made pasta to a pack of six doughnuts or four large croissants. Basically, you build your own box each month, choosing from among healthy sourdough or pasta and decadent pastries. Thistle ($13 to $16 per serving): A prior top pick for solo diners, Thistle is mostly a plant-based meal kit—but there's a $3 option to add sustainable meats to any otherwise vegan meal. It's also so local and seasonal that the West and East coasts have different menus, and the whole middle of the country, except Chicago gets none. (You can check your zip code here to see if you can get delivery.) WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has used Thistle as a means to get herself to eat more vegetables, and thus avoid a life of rickets and/or scurvy. But especially, it's friendly to the solo diner, with individually prepared meals with low to no prep. Portions are generous enough to split among meals, and in a nice turn for those who hate having to dispose of boxes, Thistle's drivers will pick up the cooler bag that housed last week's meal and replace it with a new one full of food. Vegan tester Molly Higgins' favorite meals from Thistle were a whirlwind of textures, including a Mexican-inspired corn and poblano chile salad with adobo pinto beans and a chilled lemongrass-accented rice noodle bowl that mixed spice, tang, crisply fresh veggies, and deep umami from mushrooms and seaweed. She still dreams about it sometimes. Tovala Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Tovala (~$13 a serving): It's not every day you get to try something that feels so new. Tovala offers perhaps the most ambitious solution to ready-to-heat and prepared meal delivery I've seen: The meal kits come with an oven! In contrast to the sogginess of many prepared meals, Tovala's recipes come in little foil pans with recipes custom-designed for a little steam oven. The results are often delicious, especially a recent sweet chili-glazed salmon with pickled veg and noodles, and the QR code scanning function makes each recipe seamless to cook. Stick with the meal plan for six weeks, and in the bargain you get a quite affordable and powerful little convection oven, toaster, and steamer. Tovala is best as a solution for the solo diner: Meals aren't big enough for couples, and servings are one at a time. Gobble Steak Vierge Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Gobble ($12 to $17 a serving): Gobble was our prior top pick for fast-cooked meals, in part because its speed-demon meals also offered interesting and worldly flavors. Indeed, our most recent test included Caribbean rondon, an Indonesian peanut curry stir-fry, and steak vierge. But while the flavors have stayed interesting, the focus on fast cooking appears to have waned since my colleague Louryn Strampe tested Gobble—and cook time estimates aren't printed on the recipe cards. I'm still in the process of re-testing this kit, but for now Hungryroot has taken the fast-cooking crown. For small households, Gobble is also among the most expensive kits. Ordering fewer than eight meals a week costs $15+ per serving. Nurture Life ($6 to $8 per serving): Nurture Life is like a restaurant kids' menu, in ready-to-eat meal kit form. We loved the idea behind this fresh-made, never-frozen delivery meal plan when we tested it a few years back: a bunch of toddler- and slightly bigger kid-friendly meals, from mac and cheese to spaghetti and meatballs to myriad variations on the chicken nugget. The meal prices have dipped to reasonable levels of late, meaning it's likely due for a re-test—and each contains vegetables alongside the greatest hits. Veestro ($13+ per serving): WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe enjoyed Veestro as a ready-to-eat vegan option, with premade meals delivered fresh, but with freezable options so you can have extra meals on hand in a pinch. The service offers a number of filters for other dietary requirements, and satisfying taste and texture—not always a guarantee on ready-to-eat meals. Splendid Spoon ($9 to $13 per serving): Splendid Spoon is a nutrition delivery kit that offers a plethora of plant-based smoothies, soups, bowls, noodles, and shots. Everything here is natural, plant-based, and free of gluten or GMOs, including spaghetti and plant-based “meatballs.” WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has a big yen for the smoothies in particular ($10 apiece), but wasn't quite prepared for the intensity of a lemon juice shot that comes as part of a five-pack of dense 3-ounce superfoods. Modify Health's Braised Beef (top) and Paprika Salmon (bottom) Photograph: Matthew Korfhage ModifyHealth ($10 to $13 per serving): The idea behind ModifyHealth is that food can be medicine. Sometimes, I'll admit, it tasted like it—or at least it tasted like food designed purely for nutrition rather than flavor. ModifyHealth is a prepared meal delivery service tailored to people who need a heart-healthy, low-carb, or low-FODMAP diet to avoid dire digestive or health consequences. GLP-1 weight-loss plans are also available, for diabetics or others. Gluten-free meals are attested to be made in an entirely gluten-free facility. The meals were simple, benign, and low-sodium but also sometimes a little soggy—a common problem with prepared meals. The plastic top of the packaging was also difficult to disengage from the base of each meal tray, a problem when the plastic is hot after a turn in the microwave. But here's what I do like: The meals are carefully tailored with consultation from dietitians, to help people for whom food can be a source of fear or pain. An additional service, offering one-on-one dietitian consultation, can be covered by many insurance plans. ModifyHealth also offers a free consultation for those just trying to figure out which diet plan is right for them. For those with IBS in particular, this remains the most focused food plan I've seen. Daily Harvest (prices vary): Daily Harvest is another ready-to-eat meal delivery service specializing in dietary restrictions plant-based, gluten- and dairy-free. Smoothies feature, as do harvest bowls, pastas, and grains. Calories are low. Ingredients are often inventive. The meal's a lifesaver for the solo vegan eater without time to prep a meal, and WIRED vegan reviewer Molly Higgins appreciated that the meals mostly relied on the natural flavors of the vegetables themselves, accented with flavors like curry and lemongrass. As with a lot of frozen meals, however, texture wasn't a strong suit. Meal Kits We Didn't Like Sakara Life ($30+ per serving), Sakara Life offers plant-based weekly menus in fresh, prepared portions, with greens, flavorful sauces, all-organic ingredients, and textural add-ons like seeds or berries. But it's among the most expensive meal plans we've tested, and neither WIRED reviewer who tried it has really cottoned to the thing. Tester Louryn Strampe questioned the science on health claims for detoxes and cleanses, while calling Sakara “egregiously expensive” and full of “bitter veggies and tart fruits.” Vegan tester Molly Higgins, meanwhile, said Sakara Life's tinctures and metabolism supplements didn't agree with her system, and that the mostly raw-food plan made her long for “human food.” Photograph: Matthew Korfhage; Getty Images Diet-to-Go ($10 to $14 per serving, plus shipping): Diet-to-Go predates the modern meal kit. Founded more than 30 years ago in Virginia, it's a diet plan much in the tradition of Jenny Craig, offering low-calorie microwaveable, healthy meals meant to act as total meal replacement. Keto and diabetes-friendly options exist, though the most popular “Balance” plan is geared toward weight loss, with calories limited to 1,600 a day for men and a mere 1,200 for women. Anyway, as is often true with microwaved meals that may or may not arrive frozen (it depends on the season, and where you are), proteins and starches fared better than veggies, which tended to be limp and soggy. Meals were healthy, but not always flavorful, and there were a few real misses. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

It is not uncommon for back pain to significantly impair quality of life, forcing people to take time off work or undergo long-term treatment. Furthermore, the cumulative medical costs can place a financial strain on people's lives. Against this backdrop, research that provides scientific support for measures to prevent back pain have been eagerly awaited. While it is widely known that exercise is good for overall health, specific evidence regarding the prevention of lower back pain is limited. In particular, it has long been unclear how effective simple daily actions can be. A recent large-scale study conducted by Norwegian researchers clearly shows the numerical impact of differences in walking habits on lower back pain risk: ""People who walk more than 100 minutes every day have a 23 percent lower risk of lower back problems than those who walk 78 minutes or less,"" explains Rayane Haddadj, a doctoral researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) specializing in public health. Walking Time With the Greatest Effect Hadaj and his team conducted a large-scale, four-year follow-up study of 11,194 adults (average age 55) who participated in the Norwegian Trøndelag Health Study (a cohort study of residents of Trøndelag) and who were free of chronic lower back pain at the start of the study. The study involved participants wearing accelerometers on their thighs and hips to collect data on walking time and speed over a one-week period, and then annually assessing whether they had experienced back pain lasting three months or more in the past year. The results showed that walking time is more important than walking speed in preventing back pain. While brisk walking also has some effect, it is the total amount of time walked per day that has the greatest impact on preventive effects. Those who walked 78 to 100 minutes per day had a 13 percent lower risk of back pain; those who walked 101 to 124 minutes a day had a 23 percent lower risk; and those who walked 125 minutes or more had a 24 percent lower risk. These findings demonstrate that anyone can easily take measures to prevent back pain. No special equipment or expensive training is required; simply increasing the amount of time you walk in your daily life can potentially prevent it. Anyone can easily take up the challenge, even elderly people and those who don't normally exercise, as long as they put in the time.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:34.532119

This was not a one-off episode; it followed the deployment of federal troops into multiple Democratic-led cities, prompting lawsuits and court challenges that local leaders described, with justification, as militarized intimidation. expired: police cooperating with protesters tired: police using controversial crowd-control tactics wired: police confronting protesters for content Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here. Los Angeles provided an early template. After protests erupted in June over an increase in aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, President Donald Trump ordered roughly 4,000 federalized National Guard troops into the city and activated about 700 US Marines. At the same time, he signaled—online and through traditional media—a willingness to escalate even further by invoking the Insurrection Act. Troops stood shoulder to shoulder with long guns and riot shields as smoke canisters and crowd-control munitions blanketed highways and city streets, a posture nominally framed as deescalation and for the protection of federal property but calibrated to provoke confrontation. Inside the Pentagon, officials rushed to draft domestic use-of-force guidance for Marines that contemplated temporary civilian detention—an unusually explicit entry into a legal gray area, paired with a highly visible show of force. By August, the federal government shifted from episodic deployment to direct control: Trump placed Washington, DC’s police department under federal authority and deployed roughly 800 National Guard troops, exploiting the district’s unique legal vulnerability. The Washington Post described the city as a “laboratory for a militarized approach.” The administration’s rhetoric was not subtle—Trump cast the crackdown as an image project, calling Washington a “wasteland for the world to see,” and openly endorsing fear as a policing tactic, urging officers to “knock the hell out of them.” City leaders countered that the supposed emergency was manufactured, noting that crime in the capital was at multi-decade lows. In city after city, “restoring order” became a flimsy euphemism for preemptive displays of force aimed at deterring dissent before it reached the streets. Across Chicagoland, protest control became overtly choreographed. As “Operation Midway Blitz” intensified in September, officials erected barricades and “protest zones” around the Broadview ICE facility. State police in riot gear lined perimeters, while federal agents repeatedly fired tear gas and other projectiles into crowds, according to videos and witness accounts. The most brazen moment came when homeland security secretary Kristi Noem appeared on the facility’s roof beside armed agents and a camera crew, positioned near a sniper’s post, as arrests unfolded below. This was performative policing at its most distilled: public safety reduced to a spectacle with vaguely defined urban threats cast as the danger being neutralized. The absurdity of the displays allowed routine acts of disorderly conduct to be perceived as folk-hero moments. This performative turn didn’t emerge from nowhere. It displaced a quieter, less theatrical—but still controlling—model that had dominated US protest policing for decades. Policing scholars refer to it as strategic incapacitation: a practice whereby conditions are shaped so that protests can’t become effective in the first place.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:34.956594

Your phone has the ability to automatically track the number of steps you're taking, for example. As long as you've always got it with you, it can tell you whether you're reaching that daily step count, with no other devices required. For tracking other stats, including diet and sleep, you need a third-party app as well—but there are lots to choose from, and you don't have to buy an extra fitness tracker to set your health and well-being goals. Of course there are benefits to wearables: They can constantly monitor data such as heart rate, and they're easier to strap on for a morning jog. But it's worth being aware of what your phone can do on its own—and weighing whether you need a smartwatch or fitness tracker before investing in one. Built-In Tracking Features If you're an iPhone owner, open the Health app to see all the various bits of data it can log, from the number of minutes you've been moving per day to the amount of sugar in your diet. You can enter readings for all of these categories manually, so if you're prepared to put in the time, you can build up a comprehensive picture of your health. The number of steps you take each day is something your iPhone can track using its built-in motion sensors. It’s able to do this tracking automatically as long as you keep your phone on you, and there’s nothing to enable here, as it works by default. To see the data being pulled in by your iPhone, which can also include walking speed and walking distance, tap your profile picture (top right), then Devices, then select your iPhone from the list.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:35.465588
75,75.0,75.0,75.0,75.0,125.0,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-super-flu-spreading-in-united-states-europe/,What Is the ‘Super Flu’ That Is Spreading in Europe and the United States?,"The spread of influenza became more severe this fall, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated the 2024-25 flu season as the most severe season since 2017-18. In the UK, the spread has begun earlier than at any time since 2003-04. Against this backdrop, some media outlets have begun using the term “super flu.” However, this term is not an official medical term. The actual name is “subclade K,” a new variant of influenza A H3N2. This variant has multiple mutations in a protein on the surface of the virus called hemagglutinin, making it antigenically different from the variants used in existing vaccines. This allows it to partially evade immunity acquired through previous infection or vaccines, making people more susceptible to infection. Genetic analysis by the UK Health Security Agency has revealed that 87 percent of H3N2 viruses detected since late August 2025 are subclade K. The Outbreak Began Earlier Than Usual The term “super flu” is not necessarily scientifically accurate. The H3N2 strain already caused severe illness in the elderly and children, and the new mutant strain has not made it more deadly. Contrary to the name, the virus's inherent danger is said to be no different from the conventional H3N2 strain. In 2025, the US influenza pandemic peaked in early February, with active epidemics occurring in 87.3 percent of the country. For 11 consecutive weeks, more than 50 percent of the country recorded high epidemic levels, an anomaly that led to 287 child deaths. However, these figures reflect the scale of the epidemic and do not imply an increase in the lethality of the virus itself. The influenza epidemic is hitting earlier this year in many parts of the world. While the usual peak in Japan occurs between late December and February, in 2025 the epidemic began in earnest at the end of September. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, of the 23 H3 virus strains collected in Japan between September and November 5 that could be analyzed, 22 were subclade K. The reason for the early outbreak is thought to be the decline in immunity of the population due to the countermeasures against new coronavirus infection (Covid-19), as well as a decline in physical strength due to the record-breaking heat wave. During the three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the influenza epidemic was largely suppressed. As a result, it is possible that population immunity to the virus was reduced. In fact, with the 2024 influenza pandemic in Australia at its highest level since 19 years, it would not be surprising to see a similar trend in the Northern Hemisphere. Existing Vaccines Are Effective There has also been much interest in vaccine efficacy in the face of this virulent strain. The vaccine for the 2025-26 season is based on the conventional J.2 lineage (subclade), which has different antigenicity from subclade K. However, early data from the UK has confirmed that 70-75 percent of vaccinated children and 30-40 percent of adults did not end up visiting the emergency room or being hospitalized after infection. This means that even if the antigenicity is not completely identical, the vaccine remains effective in preventing severe illness. The basic prevention measures are the same as for conventional influenza. Vaccination is recommended from October to November before the epidemic, and the effect appears about two weeks after vaccination. It is particularly recommended for people aged 65 and over, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, children aged 6 months to 5 years, and medical workers. In daily life, it is effective to thoroughly wash and disinfect your hands, and wear a mask when in crowds. Ventilation in rooms and maintaining appropriate humidity levels are also important in suppressing viral activity.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:35.944085

WIRED director Michael Calore is a fan of the Brooks Ghost line, and if you’re planning on hitting the trails in the cold, wet Pacific Northwest, I would suggest the Brooks Cascadia Gore-Tex. The Adrenaline is the company’s most popular shoe. Upcoming Brooks Sale Events to Watch Out For Do you have a runner in your life? The odds are, they’re taking stock of their winter apparel and shoes and trying to decide if these leggings are going to make it through another winter season.

I recently tried it out to make an LLC for my cosmic country band, Steel Fringe (shameless plug), and it appears to have worked just fine (we’re still waiting on a full evaluation from legal experts for a future guide to these services). If you use a LegalZoom promo code right now, you will get a discount on the service. I found it super easy to set up my LLC, and after about $500 and 30 minutes of my time, I was off to the races with an LLC for my band. I did make the mistake of spelling my co-bandleader’s middle name as his last name (I blame his wrongly named Instagram handle for this), so I had to toss them another $129 to fix that. My bad. Save on top services at LegalZoom, like LLC registration, incorporation, estate plans, and more with coupons and deals from WIRED below. Get 10% Off LLC Formation With Our LegalZoom Coupon Code If you’re in need of basic legal services like establishing an LLC, estate planning, or other contract-based services, LegalZoom offers a very simple interface that is shockingly easy to use.

If you use our exclusive code for 10% off LLC Formations (found in the table above), you’ll get a nice chunk of change off the cost of setting up your small business.

This 4K 240Hz monitor is a favorite among PC gamers, even among the huge amounts of OLED options out there. It can hit a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits in HDR, bringing scenes in games to life in vivid detail. Or if you’re on the other side of the budget spectrum and just need something basic, we recommend checking out one of HP’s 27-inch 1080p monitors, such as the HP V27i G5, which typically retails for $209. It even comes with a 75Hz refresh rate, a small but appreciated bump over the standard 60Hz. We have HP coupon codes to help you save on all this tech and even more below. $20 Off Your First Order With Our HP Promo Code HP offers a $20 discount right off the top of your order if it’s your first time buying from HP.com. While you can’t use it in addition to the other coupons, it might be a better discount if you’re purchasing something less expensive. To get this HP promo code, your order has to be $65 or more though (before taxes and shipping), and it requires signing up for the HP newsletter. This HP promo code is valid for a month after subscribing to the newsletter and is restricted to one per customer. If you aren’t planning to spend too much and it’s your first time buying from HP.com, this could be the way to go. Top HP Coupons: Laptops for Work, School, and Everyday Use One of the best laptops for work is the HP ProBook 4 G1, which is now only $501, a whopping 78% discount. We love the HP ZBook Fury 16 G11 Mobile Workstation PC for school, now $1,509 at 63% off, and a great laptop for everyday use is the HP Laptop 17t-cn300, now only $300 (66% off). HP Instant Ink: Get 50% Off With This HP Deal Printers are super handy, but one of the most annoying and expensive investments you make for it is the upkeep of ink and toner. Well, the good news is that you can save up to 50% on ink right now! With HP Instant Ink, you can save time and money with this subscription service that automatically delivers ink only when you're running low, with plans starting at less than $2 a month. Save 40% on Tech With the HP Student Discount If you’re a student—or a parent to a student, teacher, school faculty, or university staff member—you’re in luck. HP is offering a serious 40% off discount on all kinds of tech, including laptops, desktop PCs, printers, and accessories. All stuff you’ll need for school, of course. HP rebranded its laptops in 2024, introducing the OmniBooks into the world, including the premium HP OmniBook Ultra Flip. Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips and a killer OLED display, the OmniBook Ultra Flip would be a great laptop for college thanks to its long-lasting battery life, especially with a 40% discount for students or teachers. It’s not just laptops though. The HP Education Program discount applies to desktop PCs, printers, and tons more qualifying products. HP Military Discount: Get 40% Off the Latest Tech HP offers more than just a standard military discount. The company’s exclusive military discount is extended to support active service members, veterans, and their families, but also healthcare workers and First Responders. If you belong to any of those groups, the HP military discount will drop the retail prices significantly, whether you’re searching for a new laptop, PC, mouse, and many more select products at HP.com. More HP Discounts on Gaming PCs and Free Games HP’s high-performance gaming laptops and PCs are also included in this coupon code. HP has two brands of gaming laptops to choose from: the more affordable Victus and the higher-end Omen (both of which have been reviewed by me here). Finding a gaming laptop under $1,000 can be tricky, especially since you’ll want something that doesn’t use a 5-year old GPU and only 8 GB of memory. That’s why I’d avoid the cheapest Victus laptop here, and bump up to at least the Victus 16t-r100. That gets you an RTX 4050 and 16 GB of RAM, despite costing only $150 more. Meanwhile, the higher-end Omen models get you access to the new RTX 50-series graphics cards, and the new multi-frame generation feature that’s got everyone talking. They also come with a 16-inch 1920 x 1200 screen with a 240Hz refresh rate, such as the Omen Max gaming laptop. Beyond gaming laptops, HP gaming desktops like the opulent Omen 45L may also be discounted. Like the Omen Max laptops, the Omen 45L comes with RTX 50-series graphics. There’s tons of bundle promotions for discounts on gaming gear, like the HyperX Cloud Alpha wireless gaming headset and HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 wireless gaming mouse for 30% off—a total of $88 in savings.","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 06:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 14:48:37.972632

The update represents the first major Fire TV release in years from a user experience perspective, the company says, and is accompanied by a refreshed version of the Fire TV app and the arrival of new premium Fire TV televisions with colorful frames. The company saw the need for a change to the Fire TV’s look and feel as the amount of streaming content has exploded over the years. Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more. Fire TV’s simpler design “As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there’s a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.” The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what’s up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row. Image Credits:Amazon Before, you could only pin six apps to the Fire TV’s home screen — a common user complaint. But the update has reduced the app icons’ size, allowing more to be visible on the home screen, and offers you 20 app slots you can scroll through. At the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. A search button is available to the left of the Home tab. Image Credits:Amazon Across the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you’re already watching, and what’s available across services you’re subscribed to. It also offers you the ability to discover new content, including recommended movies or shows (in rows labeled “For You”), free movies you can stream, lists of the top movies or shows, and other subscription content you may want to try.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW These pages don’t offer infinite scrolling, but they’re lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services. Image Credits:Amazon The new live TV tab organizes the live content from the services that have live TV streams built into them, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you happen to subscribe. The sports section, more specifically, includes access to the live games that are on now and other scheduled sports content. Other TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options. To make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera’s feed on screen while you watch, among other things. The redesign also includes rewritten code that makes the interface move faster on some devices, Amazon claims. “On our most popular devices, this is 20% to 30% faster for the same functions, because it’s all about getting people to what they want to watch, fast,” notes Marcuss. AI comes built in Of course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art. Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription. The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote. Image Credits:Amazon The refreshed Fire TV interface and mobile app will begin rolling out in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S. Later this spring, the redesign will come to more countries and more devices, including Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen), the latest generation Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, and TVs made by partners like Hisense, Panasonic, and TCL. It will also be available at launch on the new Amazon Ember Artline TVs. (See below). Ember Artline TVs: Amazon’s new TVs that look like art Image Credits:Amazon The Ember Artline TVs are Amazon’s latest televisions that ship with a frame that can match your room’s style and colors. They’ll come in 55-inch and 65-inch options, starting at $899. The new TVs themselves offer 4K QLED screens with 800 nits of brightness. The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare. The TVs also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6. Image Credits:Amazon However, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries. This allows customers to take better advantage of Fire TV’s Ambient features, which include displaying art when the TV is not in use. The colors available include Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver. Fire TV comes with access to over 2,000 pieces of free art, or you can use your own photos. You can also ask Alexa+ to display certain photos from your Amazon Photos collections using commands like, “Alexa, create a slideshow of our family trip to Colorado” or “Alexa, show photos from our wedding.”","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 15:11:22.194540

On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini. While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web. Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home. Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.) Image Credits:Screenshot of the new Alexa app On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations. More recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber. The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW Image Credits:Amazon In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place. This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed. This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right. “Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.” But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+. Image Credits:Amazon Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year. Rausch tells us that over 10 million consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa. However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.” “Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.”","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:00:00 +0000",2026-01-05 15:11:22.532785
82,82.0,82.0,100.0,,,,verge,https://www.theverge.com/tech/852942/mira-ultra4-wand-hormone-testing-ces-2026-health,This egg-shaped gadget aims to demystify hormones… with pee,"is a senior reporter and author of the Optimizer newsletter. She has more than 13 years of experience reporting on wearables, health tech, and more. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Your urine can tell you a lot about your reproductive health hormones. Unfortunately, at-home testing can be cumbersome, involving collecting samples that are then mailed out to labs. That’s what health startup Mira is trying to simplify with its $249 Ultra4 Hormone Monitor. The pitch is to make highly accurate, readily available hormone testing for at-home users. The Ultra4 is technically two separate products. The first is the actual Hormone Monitor, which is a standalone, egg-shaped gadget that analyzes test results. The second is the Ultra4 Wand, which is a little stick you pee on that contains the actual test for four reproductive hormones: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG). By testing these four hormones simultaneously, Mira CEO and cofounder Sylvia Kang says users can not only track fertility, but also gain insights into conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), perimenopause, menopause, and even metabolic health. The hope is that by regularly testing at home, you can customize treatment for these conditions as well as notice trends based on long-term hormone levels. The collapsible pee cup is reusable. You stick the test in for 15 seconds, and the analyzer spits out results in about 16 minutes. “The goal is to help women to manage their health more proactively,” says Kang, who notes that at-home hormone testing wasn’t really a thing back when she founded Mira in 2018. “I saw so many friends trying to conceive at a late age, and the journey was really challenging. They had no idea what was wrong with them, but the only products they could purchase were ovulation kits or basal body thermometers. Neither has lab-grade accuracy or provides real understanding about what’s going on in your body.” That’s since changed. “Hormone balancing” has been a trending wellness topic over the last two years, and while influencers rarely get the facts right, the increased interest in at-home testing speaks to how frustrating treating hormonal conditions can be. Technically, Mira has been around for nearly a decade, and the new Ultra4 kit was soft-launched in late August. The company’s at CES 2026 to say the kit is now more widely available. Mira sent me an analyzer and Ultra4 Wands ahead of the show, and as someone with PCOS – who’s also right in the time frame for perimenopause — I was curious to see what using the device is like. In a nutshell, you fill out a detailed survey within the Mira app about what you’re looking to find out (i.e., fertility windows, hormone management, insight into irregular cycles, etc.) Then you pee into an included collapsible silicone cup and stick a test wand in. After about 15 seconds, you then stick the test into the analyzer and wait for 16 minutes to view your results both on-device and in the app. Depending on your goals, the app will generate a customized testing schedule. That part was easy enough, though it’s still too early for me to say what insights I’ll learn. Supposedly, a single test can give insights into cycle health and how many eggs you might have in reserve, as well as identify root causes for irregular cycles or hormonal issues. For now, my custom plan told me that I’ll need to test for five consecutive days for two straight cycles to figure out if I’m showing signs of perimenopause. Meaning, this is a device that’s meant to be used over several months to build a hormonal baseline for users. Even so, the app does provide explainers as to what each hormone does for the body and what high or low levels can mean. A little carrying case for portability. One note: Mira isn’t intended to be used as a contraceptive. It’s firmly in the realm of wellness. The gadget itself is FDA-listed as a Class I device — meaning the agency views it as very low-risk and requires less scrutiny compared to features or devices requiring clearance or approval. Kang also says that fertility isn’t the only focus for its users anymore. “Right now, 40 percent of our users are not trying to conceive. They’re interested in menopause, PCOS, and hormones in general. Specifically, in symptom management,” Kang says. The hope then is to give those users data they can use to better understand how they can improve their health. For example, a user may notice that when a certain hormone spikes, they experience specific symptoms like headaches or nausea. Knowing that specific timing may help someone discuss with their doctor how to approach treatment. Applying that logic further down the line, Kang says Mira hopes to one day expand to other biological fluids like blood and saliva for hormonal analysis. Eventually, the goal is to move beyond just reproductive health and toward “longevity” or preventive health. For example, Kang notes that early research shows that there may be a link between certain hormones and metabolic health as well. For now, cost is the biggest barrier. The Ultra4 Hormone Kit starts at $249, and replacement wand packs cost roughly $99. The analyzer alone costs $149. Even so, this all dovetails with where health tech has been heading. The covid-19 pandemic popularized and increased access to at-home testing. Hormone testing and perimenopause tech were also featured at last year’s CES. Meanwhile, Withings, Oura, and Whoop are all examples of health tech companies who have recently explored blood tests and urine as a means of promoting healthy aging.",2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 15:11:28.945371

Joining Samsung’s The Frame, Hisense CanvasTV, TCL Nxtvision, and newly announced LG Gallery TV, is Amazon’s very first art TV. The Amazon Ember Artline is a 4K edge-lit LED TV with a matte screen to reduce ambient light glare and is only 1.5 inches thick. At purchase, customers will be able to include their choice from 10 different colored frames — walnut, ash, teak, black oak, matte white, midnight blue, fig, pale gold, graphite, and silver. The Artline supports Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats and Wi-Fi 6. It uses far-field microphones so you can interact with Alexa+ from anywhere in your room and uses motion sensors (Amazon calls it Omnisense technology) to automatically detect when someone enters or leaves the room for its ambient art mode. The TV integrates with Amazon Photos to display your personal pics and create slideshows, or you can access over 2,000 pieces of art for free to show on the Artline. Amazon includes an interesting feature to allow you to better customize what art to display. By taking up to four photos of the room where you’ve set up your Ember Artline, you can get personalized recommendations based on your decor. The Amazon Ember Artline TV will be available from 55 to 65 inches starting at $899 later this spring and will support the new Fire TV OS redesign at launch.",2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 15:11:29.352873

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Alexa Plus was already popping up online for some users earlier this month, and now it’s officially available to everyone through an early access program. Anyone can go sign up at Alexa.com and start playing with the new web interface for Amazon’s new AI chatbot. Alexa Plus was already available on all new Echo devices and recently rolled out as an update to older Echoes as well. But certain tasks are just easier to do with a keyboard and mouse than they are with your voice. Now you can get access to Alexa while sitting at your laptop to update your to-do list or make reservations at that new Puerto Rican spot that recently opened up. One of the big advantages is the ability to upload documents, emails, and even images to Alexa Plus through the website and have it pull out important information. Recipes can become shopping lists, vet bills, a record of rabies vaccinations, and kids’ little league schedules can automatically be added to your calendar. Of course, Amazon is talking up its broader integrations as well, like generating meal plans and automatically filling an Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart with your groceries — even abiding by your dietary restrictions. It also puts access to your smart home devices like lights, locks, and doorbell cameras right next to your chat with Alexa. While in theory, Google Gemini should have similar smart home features, I can tell you from experience that they’re not particularly reliable. Our experience with Alexa Plus has been a bit rocky so far. So, while it’s nice to see Amazon giving its latest AI assistant a vote of confidence, maybe double-check its work before trusting that it’s filled your cart with purely vegan options. Additionally, Alexa Plus is gaining entertainment features that should mean you spend less time aimlessly scrolling through Prime Video. But, also, just watching whatever Alexa suggests and sends to your Fire TV is precisely the sort of passive consumption that many are trying to break free of. Amazon is also launching a sidebar for keeping your favorite Alexa features a click away, so you don’t need to switch windows when you want to turn up your thermostat. It’s also launching a newly redesigned Alexa mobile app.",2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 15:11:29.746099

He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed. Amazon Fire TV has been a bit long in the tooth for a while now. Its design isn’t as intuitive to navigate as Google TV, Roku, or Apple TV, and its responsiveness is frustrating. I’ve found it to be the weak link in Amazon’s portfolio for a while now, and the only major drawback to otherwise excellent TVs like the Panasonic Z95B. But after getting a demo of what Amazon has in store, I dare say I’m excited for a new Fire TV OS redesign. The new layout is better organized and reminiscent of Google TV (which has been my favorite for a few years now). It’s visually more pleasing to look at, with rounded-corner tiles instead of the harsh rectangles of the current version. And its arrangement looks far more easy to navigate. Instead of in the middle of the screen alongside installed apps, there are tabs across the top of the screen for search, home, and pages separated into movies, TV shows, sports, news, and live content. Those different tabs will aggregate content from across all of your active subscriptions, instead of only by app. If you do want to browse through your apps, they now live on their own line. And you’re no longer limited to having only six apps pinned to the homepage. You can now pin up to 20 and change their order to put your most used at the beginning of the list. There’s still sponsored content recommendations that take up a good portion of the screen, but it’s hard to escape that on any streaming OS. The sports tab will display live games you can immediately watch from services you’re subscribed to. Image: Amazon The Amazon team also redid the coding for the OS for a faster experience, saying that they’ve seen improvements in speed responsiveness of up to 30 percent. With the remote you can hit the menu button to quickly get to games, art, and photos, and Amazon’s Ambient Experience. And a long press on the home button pulls up a shortcut panel to quickly access audio and display settings, check on your connected devices (such as Ring cameras), or other regularly used controls. Amazon Alexa+ will be fully integrated with the new Fire TV OS, allowing you to search through your content, get updates and stats on your favorite sports teams, adjust your connected smart lights or thermostat, or jump to your favorite scene. Alongside the OS redesign, the Fire TV mobile app has also gotten some love. Apart from just acting as a backup remote, you can now use the mobile app to browse content, add movies and shows to your watch list, and select titles to play on your TV. The app is also accessible when you’re away from home, so if your friend suggests something while you’re out, you can still easily add it to watch later. The new Fire TV UI redesign will launch in February, starting with the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED TVs. At a date later in the spring, the update will hit the latest generation of Fire TV 4K streaming media players and TVs including the Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED series, and TVs that run on Fire TV OS from Amazon partners including Panasonic, Hisense, TCL, and Insignia. The OS will be included with the new Amazon Ember Artline TV at launch.",2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 15:11:30.145723

Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. CES 2026: all the news, gadgets, and innovations from the biggest tech show Kwikset announced a price and release date for its Aura Reach smart lock at CES 2026 this week. A more affordable Matter-over-Thread option compared to the excellent but expensive Halo Select, the Aura Reach is available now for $189. At just under $100 less than the Halo, you are sacrificing built-in Wi-Fi and an integrated door sensor that lets you know if the door is open or closed. The full-replacement deadbolt lock also has a Grade 2 security rating compared to Grade 1 on the Halo line, and a more utilitarian design. While the Aura does work with Apple Home through Matter, it doesn’t support Apple Home Key’s tap-to-unlock, which is available on the Halo Select Plus. That model costs a whopping $360, thanks to the Apple tax. However, the Aura does feature a touchscreen keypad with a built-in backlight that turns on as you approach, thanks to a proximity sensor — a nice touch. The Aura also works with Kwikset’s hands-free auto-unlock feature. This uses a combination of Bluetooth and geofencing to unlock as you approach. Plus, you can also unlock it via Bluetooth using Kwikset’s app. The lock is powered by four AA batteries that should last up to a year. Image: Kwikset While there’s no Wi-Fi, because the lock works with Matter-over-Thread, you can control it when you’re away from home by connecting it to a Matter platform, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Apple Home. However, you will need a Thread Border Router — which could be an Apple TV or an Echo smart speaker. Kwikset says the Aura also has a new optional Signal Range Boost, which “doubles Matter network performance.” This could be useful if your Thread border router isn’t near your front door. Finally, you can also just use a traditional key, and it supports Kwikset’s SmartKey Security, which lets you rekey the lock yourself. The Aura Reach is ANSI/BHMA Grade 2 certified, available in satin nickel and matte black, and now available for $189 from Amazon, The Home Depot, Lowe’s, and others.",2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 15:11:30.573157

She covers smart home, IoT, and connected tech, and has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Lifx, one of the original smart lighting brands, is launching a Matter-enabled smart mirror, its first US in-wall dimmer, and a cheaper line of bulbs and light strips starting at around $12. The company, which announced the new products at CES this week, says it plans to upgrade its entire current generation of devices to support Matter-over-Thread in addition to Wi-Fi later this year. The new Lifx SuperColor mirror features front and backlighting with Makeup Check and Anti-Fog modes. It comes with three configurable buttons that let you control other smart home devices directly from the mirror. It supports Matter, so you can connect it to Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and other platforms. Previous Next 1 / 2 Image: Lifx The 36-by-22-inch mirror can be mounted horizontally or vertically, supports hardwiring or plug-in installation, and offers individually controllable front and backlighting with full-color effects similar to Lifx’s Lunar lamp and ceiling light. Pricing hasn’t been announced, but Lifx says it will launch in Q2 2026. The $30 Lifx Smart Dimmer is also coming in Q2 and is an in-wall, paddle-style switch with four customizable buttons, a gradient light bar, and Matter support. Each button can be configured with single, double, or long-press gestures to trigger other Lifx lights or smart home scenes via a compatible Matter platform. Previous Next 1 / 2 Image: Lifx In addition to standard LED, incandescent, and halogen lightbulbs, the switch can also control Matter-compatible dimmable smart bulbs — meaning you don’t have to choose between smart switches and smart dimmable color lighting. It requires a neutral wire and is compatible with three-way setups. In the same vein as its main competitor, Philips Hue, Lifx is launching a lower-cost line of its smart lights. The Everyday line joins its premium SuperColor line and retains the brand’s 90 CRI color accuracy, but with lower RGB output than the premium offerings, according to Mark Hollands, Lifx’s chief technology officer. Image: Lifx The first products in the line are the Everyday Bulb (A19), which is an 800-lumen, full-color, and tunable white bulb, offering a 2,700-to-6,500-Kelvin range. The bulbs are available now at Amazon and Lifx.com for $24 for a two-pack. A 20-foot Everyday Lightstrip with 24 addressable zones is coming this month for $39.99. The strip’s controller also includes a configurable four-button controller that can trigger scenes on any Matter-compatible platform. From Wi-Fi to Thread All the new products and Lifx’s current line support Matter-over-Wi-Fi, but later this year, an OTA update will enable the option to switch to Thread, thanks to a dual-protocol chip. Thread is one of the networking protocols Matter uses. “Wi-Fi is the lowest common denominator for connectivity … [Thread] is still building momentum.” Lifx says it hopes this will make it easy for customers to buy and set up devices, while giving them the option to switch to Thread later if they decide they need the protocol’s broader mesh coverage or want to reduce congestion on their Wi-Fi network. “Wi-Fi is the lowest common denominator for connectivity, and while Thread has made progress in standardization and reliability, it’s still building momentum,” says Hollands. Offering both means that customers can buy and set up the product without a Thread network and move to Thread later if they want its benefits.",2026-01-05T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-05 15:11:30.990519

I haven't used Huawei's version yet, but that does have a leg up: You can use a single, dual, or all three panels with its accordion-style design. Conversely, the Galaxy Z TriFold only goes from a single panel to a triple panel. As a single panel, the 6.5-inch front screen feels quite like a normal smartphone, albeit with thicker-than-usual bezels around the screen, and a weight of 309 grams that you'll have to get used to. Flip open the screen to the right, then flip the inner layer to the left, and you get a sprawling 10-inch display to work with. Keep in mind, the Galaxy Z Fold7 nets you an 8-inch screen, but that sounds like child's play next to the TriFold. It instantly feels more like an Android tablet than any other foldable Samsung has made before. That's important because this tablet experience is the promise “book-like” folding phones have made for years, but the slight increase in screen real estate never yielded the same experience a standard tablet. The TriFold changes that—the screen here is bigger than an iPad Mini! It feels like the actual definition of a phablet.","Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:58:11 +0000",2026-01-05 15:11:33.384344

This is one of the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes showing assault and abuse — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.) In a statement shared with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.” The ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue. Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for xAI to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, which could be setting the stage for an investigation. In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom has his “full support to take action.” And while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.

Then there were all the robots on the showroom floor, where bots often serve as good marketing for the companies involved. If they don’t always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered. The ping pong player The movie Marty Supreme just came out a month ago, so I guess it’s only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year’s convention. The Chinese robotics firm Sharpa had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm’s staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I’m sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot’s. A Sharpa rep told me that the company’s main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand’s dexterity. The boxer One of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company EngineAI, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox near each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That’s too much like Robocop.” The dancer Dancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that has been scrutinized for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly run at speeds of up to 11 mph. I didn’t see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree’s booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW The convenience store clerk I stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot’s booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company’s website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant at Chinese pharmacies. The housekeeper Creating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered a fundamental test of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories. One of those businesses, the rep told me, is Monster Laundry, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna’s shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.” Dyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million Series A fundraising round in September that included funding from Nvidia’s NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung. The butler I also stopped by LG’s section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block.

On Friday, the company’s lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.” Even the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A copy of the lawsuit is available here.) The case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements. The suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors. For its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company’s lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.” What makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member.

This is an unusual move — typically, it’s the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations. Various explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn’t ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren’t accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don’t offer an acceptable settlement. The unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes. Bender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors. SandboxAQ’s lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.” Bender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.” While the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by The Information in July. Sources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company’s revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ’s full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.) Despite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia. SandboxAQ also announced a $90 million secondary sale. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, it says, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:37:59 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:00.454534

Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES’s showcase for new products) and across the show floor. As has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show’s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events. To relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here. Otherwise, let’s dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from CES. Equity sums up the highs, and lows, of CES 2026 If audio or video are more your thing, then head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube. Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots. The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin. And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more. Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors. The standout oddities of CES Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions! Highlights from CES breakout sessions CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device. Ford’s AI assistant debuts Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant. Caterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution. Hands-on with Clicks Communicator Image Credits:TechCrunch One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices. Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez: “In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold. “The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.” LG’s home robot CLOiD makes a sluggish first impression Image Credits:TechCrunch A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves: “Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.” eufyMake UV printer is an Etsy maker’s dream Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles, and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here. A new way to find and purchase office space MyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market. Sean O’Kane has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here. Check out the Skylight Calendar 2 Image Credits:Sarah Perez This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources; create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more. Check out our full impressions here. Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown. Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push. On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more. Razer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses. Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself. Lego Smart Bricks mark the company’s first CES appearance Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:36:27 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:00.888978
93,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/how-the-sleepbuds-maker-ozlo-is-building-a-platform-for-sleep-data/,"How the Sleepbuds maker, Ozlo, is building a platform for sleep data","Ozlo, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that drown out outside noise so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform. The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach. Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too. How Ozlo’s platform ambitions began Image Credits:Ozlo Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES. “The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said. The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, could use the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors could. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed. Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data. Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others. (While Patil described the relationship with Calm like this at CES, a rep for Ozlo said the companies don’t currently exchange data.) Image Credits:Ozlo For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different. “So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?” Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective. “They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says. Image Credits:Ozlo This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction. Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks. Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds. Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026. An AI to help you sleep better Image Credits:Ozlo Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest. This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (Coincidentally, the company revealed the “buddy” name in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.) By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night. The AI features are expected in the second quarter. New hardware, EEG insights on the way Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger. “We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says. Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2. In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen. The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices. Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.) Image Credits:Segotia The acquisition play Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy. The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention. “Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained. A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well. With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 19:36:04 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:01.395688
94,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/meta-signs-deals-with-three-nuclear-companies-for-6-plus-gw-of-power/,Meta signs deals with three nuclear companies for 6-plus GW of power,"Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S. Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants. Nuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways. Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it. The deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers. The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio. As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order. TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours. The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage. Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals. The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid. Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 17:51:15 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:01.763252

In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription. Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations. X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week. The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:59:24 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:02.088011
96,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/the-venture-firm-that-ate-silicon-valley/,The venture firm that ate Silicon Valley just raised another $15 billion,"Andreessen Horowitz just announced the firm has raised a little more than $15 billion in new funding. The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia. The firm, which employs many hundreds of people across five offices — three in California, plus New York and Washington, D.C. — has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice. That newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for “American Dynamism” (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It’s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes. The “where it comes from” question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio — the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history — the firm didn’t respond. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z’s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don’t really align with the firm’s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings. The Saudi connection isn’t subtle. Back in 2023, Horowitz and Marc Andreessen appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a “startup country,” adding that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.” But Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “unpaid intern” at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration — not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z’s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer. This matters because a16z’s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” — a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW Then there’s the AI bet, which might be the firm’s highest-risk, highest-reward play yet. a16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies). The firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There’s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there’s less visibility into those numbers. In a blog post published Friday morning, Horowitz writes that “as the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.” It’s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z’s mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.” Whether that happens remains to be seen. What’s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money — $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That’s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:02.418625

Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant. Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal. The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives. The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multistep workflows with a human in the loop. This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs. “With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.” This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture. In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products. The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least. Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use. Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others. OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year. A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products. While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 09:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:02.763342

On Thursday, it announced a $400 million Series F funding round at a $9 billion valuation. The New York-based outfit has now raised over $1.7 billion. This funding comes just six months after the previous $540 million round at a $6 billion valuation. The new round was led by funds managed by Blackstone with participation from existing investors including Accel, Coatue, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Sapphire, Sequoia, and others. Cyera offers what it calls data security posture management, a service that helps companies map out where all their sensitive data lives across cloud systems and databases, track how employees and applications use it, and identify security vulnerabilities. The rise of AI — which has increased both the volume of data that companies handle and concerns about data leaks — has helped Cyera sign up one-fifth of the Fortune 500 companies as customers and more than triple revenue in its last year, the company says, causing investors to eagerly pile in.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:59:56 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:03.396865

An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders. A December 31 research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5-6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. But while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark. Unsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok. It’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk. In the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.” In a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW By far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was submitted to the regulator on January 7, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 22:08:58 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:03.712916
101,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/gtmfund-has-rewritten-the-distribution-playbook-for-the-ai-era/,GTMfund has rewritten the distribution playbook for the AI era,"Building software products has never been easier, so why are so many well-funded startups failing to take off no matter how good their product is? In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era. The traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but won’t cut it in the crowded, AI-driven startup era of 2025. Innovation cycles are moving faster than ever, and what used to take several years can now be achieved in just a few months. So Irving and the GTMfund team advise their portfolio companies to differentiate in their distribution rather than their product. “The aperture for how you build your go-to-market or revenue engine and the decisions you make to get there have never had more unique and specific pathways depending on your company,” Irving said. In this episode, Irving dove into several specific examples of what he’s seen work for startups. The main takeaways: AI can help small teams hone their data-driven approach and find direct lines to their customer base through creative means; in the early days, founders can’t tackle all distribution channels at once; hiring should be approached thoughtfully without a traditional mindset; and building a team of trusted advisers should be a top priority. Early-stage investors, at least at GTMfund, aren’t looking for startups that have spent half their budget on paid ads or hired a full sales team. They want to see founders get creative with how they reach their unique customers. Irving laid out an example of one startup that became an active participant in several relevant Facebook groups. “If you think about it in the framework of, okay, it’s a thousand people, but 700 of them are my actual ICP and buyer because of the specific groups that either we started as a company or the ones that we’ve become the most active posters in. It can become a really unique channel if you’re looking to bring on 40, 50, 60 new customers in a given year,” he said. Irving argues that the aperture for going to market has never been broader, so it’s crucial for founders to carve out a creative approach for reaching their target customer. However, founders can’t and shouldn’t do it alone. A refrain throughout this conversation is the importance of a robust network. GTMfund provides their portfolio companies with a vast network of operators, but they won’t just hand founders a Rolodex — they create bespoke pairings to ensure that there will be value in the meeting for everyone involved. “I think what’s wonderful about the venture-backed ecosystem more generally is people’s willingness to help. They know how hard it is to build a company. They know how low the likelihood of success is in the grand scheme of things, but people are always willing. If you come and you’re curious, you teach them something as part of that as well. People are usually willing to open up doors,” Irving said.

102,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/critics-pan-spyware-maker-nsos-transparency-claims-amid-its-push-to-enter-us-market/,Critics pan spyware maker NSO’s transparency claims amid its push to enter US market,"NSO Group, one of the most well-known and controversial makers of government spyware, released a new transparency report on Wednesday, as the company enters what it described as “a new phase of accountability.” But the report, unlike NSO’s previous annual disclosures, lacks details about how many customers the company rejected, investigated, suspended, or terminated due to human rights abuses involving its surveillance tools. While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either. Experts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from a blocklist — technically called the Entity List — as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm. Last year, a group of U.S. investors acquired the company, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman was appointed the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported. “When NSO’s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place. That will always be our overriding mission,” Friedman wrote in the report, which does not mention any country where NSO operates. Natalia Krapiva, the senior tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a digital rights organization that investigates spyware abuses, told TechCrunch: “NSO is clearly on a campaign to get removed from the U.S. Entity List and one of the key things they need to show is that they have dramatically changed as a company since they were listed.” “Changing the leadership is one part and this transparency report is another,” said Krapiva. “However, we have seen this before with NSO and other spyware companies over the years where they change names and leadership and publish empty transparency or ethics reports but the abuses continue.” Contact Us Do you know more information about NSO Group?

Ever since the Biden administration added NSO to the Entity List, the company has lobbied to have its restrictions lifted. After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts. But, as of May last year, NSO had failed to sway the new administration. In late December, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against three executives tied to the Intellexa spyware consortium, in what some saw as a sign of a shift in the administration’s attitude toward spyware makers. A lack of details This year’s transparency report, which covers 2025, has fewer details than reports from previous years. In an earlier transparency report covering 2024, for example, NSO said it opened three investigations of potential misuse. Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer “alternative remediation measures,” including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation. NSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million “in new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.” In the transparency report published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million. In 2021, NSO said it had “disconnected” the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in “estimated loss of revenue,” and it also said that it “discontinued engagements” with five customers due to “concerns regarding human rights.” NSO’s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics that have been consistently present in previous reports. TechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO. “I was expecting information, numbers,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Nothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO’s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade-long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.”","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:15:32 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:04.373463

If you’re unfamiliar with nitro coffee, it’s cold brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas. This process creates tiny bubbles, resulting in a silky-smooth, naturally sweeter taste — similar to drinking a Guinness. Many people also note that nitro coffee is less bitter. EverNitro is positioning itself against competitors such as NitroBrew as a long-term more affordable all-in-one solution. “We offer the quality of a commercial tap with the footprint of a coffee maker. While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said. ​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use. Image Credits:XBREW Lab After testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised. The machine is simple to use, and it fits easily on a counter or stores comfortably on a shelf — making it a nice addition to any kitchen or bar setup. The canister accommodates coffee, cocktails for that bar-quality touch, or other beverages. Users can select their preferred pressure, which ranges from 0 to 8 BAR (a metric unit of pressure). The entire process, from loading your beverage to enjoying the finished drink, takes only minutes. There’s also a companion app that delivers updates. The device launched on Kickstarter in October and raised over $570,000 — a testament to strong interest in this product despite its premium price point. The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of NitroBrew costs about $1,000.

104,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/i-watched-lgs-new-home-robot-cloid-do-laundry-but-i-have-questions/,I watched LG’s new home robot CLOiD do laundry but I have questions,"CES is always chock-full of robots, and this year electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOiD, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore). CLOiD is described as an AI-powered home robot, designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. The company says that, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.” The bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience. CLOiD has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s smart home ThinQ app, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says. The bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOiD runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri). The last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including Amazon’s Astro and Enabot’s EBO X. CLOiD follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOiD has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment. You’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.

During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOiD to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk. Yes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOiD. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “Zero Labor Home” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least. From the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.” An on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOiD would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information. Thus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOiD felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home. I got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the return of the LG Wallpaper (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had a variety of appliances on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOiD and are controllable via the company’s ThinQ app.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:04:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:05.061466

Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that monitors internet traffic worldwide, concurred, telling TechCrunch that Iran’s internet has been in “near-total blackout” since around 11:30 a.m. on the U.S. east coast on Thursday, or 8 p.m. local time in Tehran. A chart showing how internet traffic dropped in Iran on Thursday around 11:30 a.m. ET Image Credits:Kentik Internet traffic monitor NetBlocks, internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, and internet connectivity tracking site IODA, all registered sudden drops in connectivity across Iran at the same time. “We continue to see a small amount of traffic, but the country is effectively completely offline,” David Belson, the head of data insight at Cloudflare, told TechCrunch. At the end of December, protests erupted in several cities in Iran, following a sharp drop in the value of the country’s currency, prompting shortages of goods and dramatic spikes in prices. Some shops in Tehran’s traditional bazaar have been closed for 11 days, according to The New York Times. Iran’s government has responded by violently cracking down on the protesters. The Iranian government, which maintains a tight control over the country’s internet access, is behind the internet blackout, according to Rashidi. Representatives for the Iranian government in the United States did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website was down at the time of publication.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:35:14 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:05.393760
106,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/openai-to-acquire-the-team-behind-executive-coaching-ai-tool-convogo/,OpenAI to acquire the team behind executive coaching AI tool Convogo,"OpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal. Convogo’s product will be wound down. The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo. In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes. “We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.” The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.

107,,,,,,,techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/andurils-palmer-luckey-thinks-the-future-of-tech-is-in-the-past/,Anduril’s Palmer Luckey thinks the future of tech is in the past,"You might think it’s pretty weird to hear the founders of a VR company and a social media platform publicly complaining about how things used to be better back in the dial-up days. Nevertheless, that is what happened at CES on Wednesday, when Oculus creator Palmer Luckey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian gave a joint talk about the joys of “tech nostalgia.” Luckey, who initially made his fortune in VR and now runs the defense contractor Anduril, and Ohanian both seemed to agree: Stuff was better in the old days. The catch, however, is that Luckey and Ohanian weren’t really criticizing technology itself (Luckey said, during his remarks, that he supported AI and felt it was changing workflows for the better); instead, they were criticizing the aesthetics of technology. Vintage consumer tech products, they argued, are superior to today’s — and it’s the styles and form factor of the past that will determine tech’s future, they claimed. “It’s not just about nostalgia for the old; it’s about the fact that it’s just objectively better,” Ohanian said of some older products. After going on a short tirade about how great the 1999 first-person shooter Quake: Arena is, Luckey similarly sang the praises of old-school media. “There is something that used to exist in the intentionality of building a music library — whether that was building whole albums or building mix tapes,” Luckey said, adding that, in the era of endless downloads, you clearly “lose something.” Luckey also pointed to younger people who are nostalgic for time periods that they don’t even remember or have any personal connection to. “Why do they think it’s good? It’s not because they’re remembering their childhoods. It’s not because they’re harkening back to some earlier time. It’s because they’re recognizing that it is literally better, some of this old stuff.” Certain consumer trends would seem to suggest that Luckey and Ohanian are on to something. Nostalgia is obviously big across the board these days (look at all those 1980s period pieces coming out of Hollywood), but nostalgic tech design is a particularly thriving niche. Young people are overwhelmed and oversaturated by the internet. As a result, many have developed new interests in physical media — like collecting cassettes and vinyl. Meanwhile, new, low-tech devices with retro designs are also seeing an uptick in interest (just check out the Clicks Communicator phone that debuted at CES this year).

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW Given that consumer interests are trending this direction, Luckey and Ohanian’s enthusiasm for vintage tech could also just end up being a savvy business strategy. That is, if Americans are feeling nostalgic, you might as well monetize it. Indeed, Luckey has already been doing this. The defense contractor, who sports an ’80s mullet, launched a project in 2024 called ModRetro Chromatic — a Game Boy-like device that retails for $199, allows gameplay of old cartridge classics from the 1990s, and has been called one of “the best ever made” of its kind. On Wednesday, Ohanian brought one of the ModRetro units onstage and proudly showed it off to the crowd. Ohanian, who has spoken very publicly about his love for Luckey’s gaming company, has also said he’s interested in creating his own vintage-style game. There were a lot of colorful moments during Wednesday’s talk, most of which were generated by Luckey. At one point, he shared that he had been coming to CES since he was 16. Astute CES fans will note: You’re supposed to be 18 to get in. “I used a fake ID,” Luckey told a CES audience on Wednesday, to much laughter. “I pretended that I worked for a company that was exhibiting here,” the mogul said. Cute retro games may be the future but so, too, is war, it would seem. Since 2017, Luckey has largely been focused on his defense startup Anduril. Earlier this year, in the wake of a Series G fundraising round, the company’s valuation swelled to $30.5 billion. Lately, the company has been collaborating with Meta on headsets for the U.S. military. Anduril hardly came up during Wednesday’s talk, but toward the end of the conversation, Luckey pivoted briefly to a discussion about foreign policy to make some characteristically wild claims. “I was part of the problem for a long time, making all of my stuff in China,” he said. “Geopolitically, the United States and China are going through a divorce; it’s a messy divorce — and if people think that it’s going to end with reconciliation, they’re blind. It’s not,” he said.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:05:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:06.079859

Disney made the announcement at its Tech + Data Showcase event at CES 2026. The company said in the blog post that the experience “will evolve as it expands across news and entertainment and delivers a more personalized, dynamic experience that reinforces Disney+ as a must-visit daily destination.” Disney told Deadline that the videos could include original short-form content, repurposed social clips, scenes from TV shows or movies, or a combination. “We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Erin Teague, EVP of Product Management for Disney Entertainment and ESPN, told Deadline. “So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience.” The move comes as Disney launched a personalized vertical video feed in the ESPN app last year. By introducing short-form video content to Disney+, the company is targeting younger users who are accustomed to watching quick clips on their phones rather than long-form content like TV shows and movies. Disney+ won’t be the first streamer to explore vertical video, as Netflix launched a vertical feed last year that lets users scroll through clips from its original titles.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:59:45 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:06.392204

We found plenty on sale and highlighted the best picks below. Not all of the deals are related to New Year’s resolutions, though; there are also a number of other worthwhile deals worth checking out. Despite the Consumer Electronics Show wrapping up earlier this week, we’re already seeing deals roll in, for example. And if your main goal is to unwind this weekend, we’ve spotted solid deals on Blu-rays to help you relax. Below, you’ll find all of our favorite deals from this week. Of fitness trackers on sale right now, the deal on the Amazfit Active 2 is ideal, especially if you’re on a budget. It’s currently on sale for just $84.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is just $5 shy of its lowest price to date. ​​We think the Active 2 is one of the best fitness tracker you can currently buy, namely because it offers a feature set you don’t typically don’t find at this price point. It covers most of the health and fitness features people need and then some, with continuous heart rate and blood oxygen tracking, in addition to menstrual cycle tracking. You also get offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation and up to nine days of battery life — far longer than most smartwatches. It looks stylish, too, thanks to its stainless steel case and 2,000-nit OLED display that makes it seem more expensive than it is.

You can keep it to the right or left of a keyboard like a traditional trackball, or you can tuck it in front and use it without moving your hands from the keys. That positioning makes it a bit like a giant Lenovo TrackPoint, typically found on ThinkPad laptops but sometimes used on dedicated keyboards.

111,,,,,,,verge,https://www.theverge.com/tech/858910/linux-diary-gaming-desktop,I replaced Windows with Linux and everything’s going great,"Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop. In November, I got fed up and said screw it, I’m installing Linux. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening. My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS without spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s increasingly annoying OS. Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that only works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer. Day one Spoiler alert: it worked. Screenshot: Nathan Edwards/The Verge I picked CachyOS rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the installation instructions in the Cachy wiki and download the CachyOS live image to a Ventoy USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image. First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image. I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like Pop_OS! and Mint, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on Arch, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall. Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the Dual Boot Diaries podcast — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders. Why did I leave all that blank space on the drive? Couldn’t tell you. I had to go fix it later. Image: Nathan Edwards / The Verge I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later. Next, I have to pick one of thirteen different desktop environments. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t. And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name. Tried getting Linux on my laptop over Christmas. Didn’t work. Photo: Nathan Edwards / The Verge Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows. Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons still aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try unplugging the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7; it turns out this is a known issue. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged. Stuff that works The Cachy welcome screen gives you a little selection of popular Linux apps to install. Screenshot: Nathan Edwards / The Verge That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings. There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging. I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works. What’s missing I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later. Shall we play a game? Heroic Games Launcher lets you download and play games from your Epic, GOG, and Amazon libraries. Screenshot: Nathan Edwards / The Verge Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and Heroic (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try one game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading The Outer Worlds, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that only works for gaming. The children yearn for the mines So close… Screenshot by Nathan Edwards / The Verge …and yet so crash. Screenshot by Nathan Edwards / The Verge The biggest issue I’ve had so far is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play Minecraft with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with MCPE Launcher, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step. Stuff I haven’t tried yet I hear good things about howdy, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the Zen browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface. I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma theme that makes it look like Windows XP, though. Just because. Regret level: none I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature. Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play Minecraft with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.) I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.",2026-01-10T10:00:00-05:00,2026-01-10 20:45:08.121812

LG introduced CLOiD, a household robot it says can handle chores like preparing food and loading the washing machine. SwitchBot showed off the Onero H1, another home helper built to tackle everyday tasks, and Boston Dynamics, WIRobotics, Zeroth, and others debuted even more impressive humanoids. Advances in robotics and AI have made robots smarter and more capable than ever. The question is whether they’re capable enough to do our chores. We already have robots that vacuum our floors and mow our lawns — but there’s one job they haven’t mastered: laundry. Laundry is a complex, multistep chore many of us would happily hand off to a robot: collecting, sorting, loading, unloading, folding, and carrying. At CES, nearly every company claimed its household robot could handle it, with demos showing bots loading washers and folding clothes. The Verge decided to try and put these promises to the test on the show floor to see if these robots are really as capable as they claim, or if the future of smart home robotics actually lies in the smaller, single-purpose machines that were also everywhere at CES. Join senior smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy in her quest to see how close we are to a robot that can do her laundry. Along the way, she talks to the president of robot vacuum giant Roborock, the CEO of the newest humanoid startup, Zeroth, and other experts in the robot space to find out whether the humanoid trend is inevitable or just classic CES vaporware.

113,,,,,,,verge,https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850479/desk-pc-keyboard-razer-kobo,"What’s on your desk, Stevie Bonifield?","Stevie Bonifield is a news writer here at The Verge and, they say, “I cover a little bit of just about everything, from the FCC to AI shopping tools to Linux.” Before joining our news team, they wrote weekend news for PC Gamer and did reviews, news, features, and guides for Laptop Mag, along with some stories for Tom’s Guide, IGN, TechRadar, and XDA. “I’ve been reading (and watching) The Verge since I was in high school,“ they add, ”so it’s pretty exciting to be part of the team now.“ Outside of writing, Stevie says “I also love gaming, reading, and TTRPGs (tabletop roleplaying games). As you’ll probably be able to tell from my workspace, I’m kind of a total nerd.” Let’s begin with the basics. Where is your work space located? My desk and work space are in my bedroom. I share my apartment with a roommate, so we both work from our bedrooms so we don’t distract each other during the day. I don’t really mind not having a separate office — it means I only have to worry about decorating and managing one space instead of two. I recently moved to New Jersey from Pittsburgh, PA, so I’m still getting everything set up here. A VIVO adjustable desk, together with a Haworth Breck chair, makes working more comfortable. Could you tell us about your desk and your chair? I’m using a VIVO 3-stage adjustable desk with a VIVO 60-inch desktop and a Haworth Breck chair. I got both when I moved last month, so I haven’t been using them for long, but I like them so far. This is actually a standing desk, which I’ve never used before. I got it so I could have my desk height pretty low — I’m on the shorter side and most desks are too high for me. This one goes all the way down to 24 inches, lower than even I need, which is really nice. The option to use it as a standing desk is a cool perk, even though that isn’t what I bought it for. My cable management under the desk still needs some cleaning up, but I’m working on it! I have a VIVO clamp-on cable management net containing most of it for now. I like the Haworth Breck so far, but it’s a pretty basic chair. Like my desk, a big part of why I got this one is its height range. It’s extremely difficult for me to find decent desk chairs that go as low as I need them to (without requiring a footrest). This one has a minimum seat height of around 15 inches and has adjustable seat depth, both of which I’ve really appreciated. That said, I wish it had a headrest. Tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. My setup is a little crazy because I have three different computers running to my two monitors. A gaming PC with unfortunate issues. This desk side device lets laptops hang off the side of the desk. My gaming PC lives on the floor under my desk. It’s currently temporarily out of commission because I’m having a hardware issue. Unfortunately, my RAM seems to be on the fritz, which is pretty bad timing considering the current RAM pricing nightmare. Most of it is still working, though! It has an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU, an AMD Radeon RX 6600 GPU, an Asus ROG Strix B650-A motherboard, and a pair of 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM sticks (which apparently need to be replaced, after less than a year of use). That’s also my Linux PC — it’s currently running Fedora 41 with the Cinnamon desktop environment, but I’m updating to Fedora 43 soon and planning to switch to the KDE Plasma desktop environment. Hanging off the side of my desk are my work and personal laptops, both the M4 MacBook Air. My laptops are only connected to my left monitor, which is a 27-inch 1440p Viewsonic Omni (VX2728J-2K). My gaming PC is connected to both monitors. I mainly play games on the right monitor since it has better color accuracy. It’s a 27-inch 1440p Asus ROG Strix gaming monitor (XG27ACS). Neither one of my monitors is anything fancy, but both are good enough for my needs. Between the two, I would probably recommend the ROG one more, although I’m not a huge fan of the buttons being located on the back since I need those to swap input modes so I can switch to my Mac. When I’m working during the day I usually have my work laptop running on the left monitor and my Linux PC on the right monitor. My keyboard and mouse I chose specifically because they make it easy to jump between all my devices. The Nuphy Halo75 V2 with Nuphy’s Mint switches. This mouse is Stevie’s favorite right now. I’ve reviewed quite a few keyboards, so it’s a little ironic that the one I’m using now I actually haven’t reviewed. It’s the Nuphy Halo75 V2 with Nuphy’s Mint switches. It sounds and feels great, works really smoothly with macOS, and I can jump between my laptops and PC with a quick keyboard shortcut. The battery life could be a bit better, but admittedly I leave the RGB on, so that’s probably not helping. Overall, though, I really like the design and sound quality on the Halo75 — it’s one of the only keyboards I’ve tried that I’m happy with out-of-the-box without making any DIY customizations. My mouse is actually one of my favorite devices right now. I’ve tested some great gaming mice, but this one is my personal daily driver and not one I reviewed. It’s the Razer Orochi V2, and I got it on sale for $35 on Amazon earlier this year. It’s nothing fancy, but the size and feel are perfect for me. Most gaming mice feel kind of enormous in my hand, but I swear Razer designed the Orochi for my palm specifically. Like my keyboard, it’s also able to jump between a Bluetooth connection and a 2.4GHz dongle. Despite the budget-friendly price, it’s a great mouse. Underneath that I’m currently using a Matrix Blizzard mousepad. I got it on Amazon, but unfortunately, I think it’s sold out now. I wanted something with a little bit of a design going on, but not anything too detailed or distracting. This design just about perfectly fit what I was looking for. I wish it was a tad thicker, but it’s more interesting than a plain black mousepad, and that’s good enough for me. I have two controllers on my desk, a standard Xbox controller for my Mac and the wired Razer Wolverine V2 for my gaming PC. I don’t normally like wired controllers, but I really love the Wolverine. The clicky buttons on Razer controllers are so satisfying to me, and they tend to offer consistently good performance in my experience. My favorite mobile controller is also from Razer, the Kishi Ultra. My preferred headphones are my AirPods Pro 3. The ANC and spatial audio is fantastic for watching shows and movies on my laptop (and helps me focus when I’m working). I don’t like wearing earbuds all the time, though, so I also keep a basic pair of on-ear Sony headphones around, the WH-CH250. The audio quality on these isn’t particularly impressive, but they’re super affordable. Last, but certainly not least, I also have a Razer Seiren V3 Chroma mic off to the side of my desk on a clamp-on mic arm I got on Amazon. I’ve been using the Seiren for a couple years now for gaming and playing Dungeons & Dragons with my online group. The audio quality could be a bit better, but it’s a significant improvement over most built-in headphone mics, and I’ve never had any bugs or issues with it. Notably, it works on Linux for me without needing any tweaks or work-arounds. That is a great laptop holder you have at the side of your desk. What is it? I just got that when I moved last month, and it’s one of my favorite additions to my desk setup. It’s a double-decker laptop mount I got for around $30 on Amazon and just clamps onto the side of my desk (no screws necessary!). I wanted to free up some desk space, and this lets me keep both of my laptops nearby and out of the way at the same time. I also used a command strip to stick a USB-C hub to the back of the laptop tray, so I can quickly hop between my personal and work laptops on my external monitor by just moving over the USB-C cable and charging cable. Great wall decorations. Tell us a bit about your Elmville map and what surrounds it. This is the wall across from my desk that people see when I have my webcam on, so I put all my coolest stuff on it. I’m a huge fan of Dimension 20 on Dropout, so I immediately picked up one of those Elmville maps when they released them. For those who haven’t checked out Dimension 20 yet, Elmville is the main setting for Fantasy High, one of the best shows Dropout has to offer, in my humble opinion. There is a lot of really cool stuff up on the wall across from the desk. The smaller horizontal picture below the map is actually a page from Dropout’s 2025 Dimension 20 calendar that I got at their Madison Square Garden show last January. It’s a scene from season 2 of Fantasy High, and I just thought the artist did such a great job with it that it deserved to be framed. Off to the right above that one is a print I got from an art convention. It’s not from any show or movie as far as I know; the design just resonated with me. The two smaller prints above the map are also from art conventions and were made by the same artist, Natasha Tara Petrović. The purple one is some cool Mothman art — I have a soft spot for cryptids and spooky stuff. The blue one is a Dark Souls print that makes the game look way cozier than it is. And last but not least, I’ve got some Nanoleaf Elements tiles lighting up that wall. These are the first smart lights I’ve ever bought, and they’re pretty cool, especially with the more mellow wood look. I have them set to shift colors and brightness throughout the day. You’re obviously into Star Wars and other science fiction / fantasy worlds, judging from the toys over your bookcase and the figures on that little shelf. Are you a serious fan or do you just like the genre? I am a huge Star Wars fan. One of my earliest memories is watching The Phantom Menace on VHS, and I’ve loved the franchise ever since. Obi-Wan is my favorite character, which I’m noticing is a bit obvious in my work space. The lightsaber above my bookcase is Obi-Wan’s from The Phantom Menace. I’ve had it since probably kindergarten or first grade, so it’s a little beat up. And next to that I’ve got a special edition Obi-Wan Funko Pop. Then above my desk I have a Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter from Attack of the Clones. On the shelf below that I’ve managed to squeeze in the Dungeons & Dragons series minifigures I’ve collected (I’m a few shy of the full collection). These shelves ended up being way smaller than expected, so I’m planning to add more so things aren’t quite so cramped. I thought Lego did a great job with these D&D minifigures, though, and would love to see them do more D&D sets. My personal favorite from this series is the dragonborn paladin. Obi-Wan’s lightsaber from The Phantom Menace along with some Funko Pops. A Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter. A collection of Dungeons & Dragons series minifigures. And finally, the rock collection. The other Funko Pop next to Obi-Wan is Vi from Arcane, which is a truly phenomenal show and a personal favorite of mine. I’m not much of a Funko Pop person, but I’ll get them from time to time if it’s a character I really like. I guess I would say I’m a serious sci-fi and fantasy fan, although I tend to connect with specific series or books and stick with those. To go back to the Star Wars example, on one of the lower shelves in my bookcase, I have most of the old Jedi Apprentice books. They’ve gotten pretty hard to find, but I loved them as a kid, so I’m trying to collect them all again. On the fantasy side of things, I love epic fantasy like Lord of the Rings, but also like some YA books, especially The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson. At the moment, I’m reading The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss and Brigands & Breadknives by Travis Baldree, which is the third book in his Legends & Lattes series. Both are great, although they have drastically different tones. You also have a rock collection! I do! Much like a goldfish, it has grown to fill the size of its container, and now it can grow no more. I’ve always had an interest in geology and have had some of the rocks and minerals in that case since I was a kid. I have a bunch of quartz, a geode, some copper, chalcopyrite, amazonite, dravite, moissanite, a sliver of obsidian, a lump of basalt, some feldspar and sedimentary rocks, and a bunch of smaller tumbled stones. There’s also a chunk of petrified wood in the back that I found in a streambed. My favorites are the chunk of amber in the front and the bismuth above it — I love how bismuth crystals get that neat geometric shape. Anything else I missed that you’d like to add? While I don’t use it for work, my Kobo Clara BW e-reader is almost always on my desk. My bookcases are pretty much full (and a bit small — I’m planning to replace them eventually), so I’ve been reading more ebooks over the past year or so. I switched from a Kindle to a Kobo several months ago and have been loving the Kobo. The display and user experience on the Clara are better than their Kindle counterparts in my experience, and you have more freedom to add books from outside Kobo’s store and back up everything in your library on other devices. My Kobo is in my everyday carry now, although in hindsight, I wish I’d gotten one with a color display. Photography by Stevie Bonifield",2026-01-10T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-10 20:45:09.060873
114,,,,,,,verge,https://www.theverge.com/games/859675/diora-review-playdate-monument-valley,The Playdate gets its Monument Valley,"Diora might be the most ambitious game I’ve played on the Playdate. It’s all about perspective: You turn the handheld’s crank to rotate your viewpoint of the bite-size 3D landscapes, which lets you peek around corners to find solutions to various puzzles. On a device with a 1-bit, black-and-white display, the miniature worlds feel miraculous, like little dioramas you can spin around in your hands. But the most impressive part is the puzzles that will have you twisting your brain as much as the crank. In Diora you play a “network technician” traveling to various locations across a city, fixing up machinery in the wake of a strange accident. Repairing things is easy; all you have to do is reach the computer at the end of each level. Getting there is the hard part. Diora starts out relatively simple. You hit switches to open up gates or push platforms to create pathways. What makes these familiar puzzles interesting, though, is how Diora plays with your viewpoint. You have to constantly shift where you’re looking to find the right way forward. This can turn even seemingly simple challenges into real brain-scratchers. Each level also steadily ratchets up the intensity. Most have you exploring multi-level structures where the first few floors introduce a concept before hitting you with something more complex. It’s reminiscent of Monument Valley or Fez, though Diora is different in a few key ways. For one, the architecture (mostly) isn’t filled with M.C. Escher-inspired impossibilities, but instead buildings and structures rooted in reality. And whereas Monument Valley is an almost serene experience, Diora can get really hard. I found myself stuck on more than one occasion, as many of the solutions involve making decisions in a very precise order. There’s no hint system to help you out, which can be frustrating, but Diora does at least have a checkpoint system that means you won’t be replaying huge chunks of the game after making a mistake. This game is also a good sign that, a few years after launch, developers are really pushing the edges of what the Playdate is capable of. There aren’t many 3D titles on the handheld, and Diora has a sort of grittiness that both fits the Playdate’s aesthetic and lends the game a surprisingly chill postapocalyptic vibe. Diora even has a built-in level editor so you can create your own puzzles. Not long ago I wrote that one of the Playdate’s strengths was its steadily growing library of puzzle games. They suit the device perfectly: experiences you can play in short bursts when you’re on the go, but also lose yourself in when you’re traveling or otherwise killing time. Diora is right near the top of the list of games I’d recommend; it’s technically impressive, but more importantly, it’s a puzzler that forces your brain to see things in different ways.",2026-01-10T09:00:00-05:00,2026-01-10 20:45:09.461988
115,,,,,,,verge,https://www.theverge.com/tech/859808/ces-2026-best-gadgets-installer,The CES 2026 stuff I might actually buy,"Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 111, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, hope you had a wonderful holiday season, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.) I also have for you a bunch of the best stuff out of this year’s CES! Our whole team does an incredible job of covering all the news, and you should be sure and check out our awards for the show’s best stuff. For our purposes here, I tried to just grab a bunch of the best and most interesting stuff that actually feels real. (I’m linking here largely to our coverage instead of normal product pages, because in many cases, there aren’t any yet.) Real in the sense that (a) it will actually ship and work and (b) it might actually be worth your money. A hard task the week of CES! Oh, and before I forget, tiny housekeeping thing: this newsletter will now be live on our website the same time it hits your inbox. Since it’s all for subscribers, no good reason to wait a day anymore! Read it in email, read it on the site, read it in RSS — it’ll be there every Saturday morning starting now. Let me know if you run into any issues! Now let’s get into it. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you watching / reading / listening to / bedazzling / still setting up from the holidays this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.) The Drop Screen share At some point in the very near future, I’m going to spend too many thousands of dollars on an e-bike. This will be almost entirely Andy Hawkins’ fault. In addition to being The Verge’s transportation editor, he’s also our foremost proponent of ditching your car and going full-on cargo bike. Yes, if you ask, he will lead your bike bus. I asked Andy to share his homescreen this week, since there’s always so much interesting future-of-transit stuff happening at CES. (Side note: I test-drove an Infinite Machine Olto while in Vegas, it was fabulous.) Andy didn’t go to Vegas this year, presumably because he couldn’t bike that far, but he did agree to share with us. Here’s Andy’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone: iPhone 16. I was content to run my iPhone 11 into the ground, but my mother insisted I join her family plan, so we all got upgrades last year. It’s a bit skinnier than my iPhone 11, which is fine but took some getting used to. A week after I got it, my kid touched the screen with a sparkler, and now it has a weird permanent burn in the lower left hand corner, kind of like the Eye of Sauron. So that’s cool. The wallpaper: Typically a photo of my kids. I recently selected the option in settings for a new wallpaper photo every hour, and I’ve been delighting in the old baby pics and occasional random sunset or cityscape photo. The apps: Camera, YouTube, Weather, Bluesky, Google Maps, Slack, Photos, TikTok, Phone, Instagram, The Verge, Spotify, Gmail, Messages, Chrome, Telegram. The top half of my homescreen is devoted to folders for things like streaming music and TV, news, navigation, social media, banking, etc. The bottom half is for my most-used apps: Instagram, Spotify, Google Maps, Photos, Camera, and, of course, The Verge. Those can change sometimes. For example, I’ll move Instagram and TikTok out (or delete them entirely), if I’m in the mind to reduce my doomscrolling. The dock is reserved for nonnegotiables: Gmail, iMessage, Telegram, and Chrome. My wife is the opposite. Her phone is just a chaos of random apps spread across multiple screens. Couldn’t be me. I also asked Andy to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back: I’ve been really enjoying Letterboxd lately. It’s not the most well-designed app, but as an aspiring insufferable film snob, it scratches the itch I have right now for escape and distraction. Sometimes you just want to open an app and not immediately see the worst thing you’ve ever seen or some pathetic AI slop. Sometimes you just want to read hilarious one-sentence reviews of Marty Supreme Relatedly, I’ve been watching a lot of pre-code movies, like Howard Hughes’ Hell’s Angels and all the old gangster movies like Scarface and Little Caesar . The acting is a little goofy, but the dialogue and practical effects (Real planes! Real bullets!) can’t be beat. Geese’s Getting Killed album. I’m a 46-year-old white guy. This shit is like crack to me. I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but nothing beats riding bikes, especially with kids. My son just got his first geared bike and it’s been a game changer. We ride the bike bus every Friday, even in the winter, and it’s a real mood lifter. The world is dark and scary and sometimes it feels like nothing good will ever happen again. But then you’re riding down a hill with your kid and he’s yelling “Wee!” and suddenly it’s not so bad. Crowdsourced Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky. “Slow Gods, by Claire North. It’s a banger!” — Eliot “I’m relistening to old Retronauts pods. The more Bob Mackey in my life, the better.” — Brad “An app I started using because Instagram has decided that authentic content was meaningless has been Retro. I got a free year of the premium subscription and am basically just using it as a personal photo journal rather than a social network.” — Ryan “This glorious video, ‘Durrr ChatGPT.’ It’s mind-boggling when I see people use it for practically everything these days. This video perfectly captures my mood and I keep going back to it. It is made with pure rage and you can feel it.” — Yagya “Just got myself a Pixel Buds 2a after realising that I don’t, in fact, need some expensive Ultra or Pro earbuds. Love these things and how light they are. They just work! (And have no settings I need to dig deep for!) Bonus points for acting as a temporary Find My tracker. All this at $99.” — Anshuman “This deep dive into why the ATSC 3.0 NextGen TV rollout and deployment has been such a fiasco is fascinating and slightly infuriating!” — Eric “I recommend the Espro portable coffee maker. I travel to Italy for work regularly and the country has a coffee volume problem for Americans. No, that one-ounce espresso isn’t going to wake me up. I tried an Aeropress previously but it has a lot more pieces and cleanup. The Espro gives me a decent volume with easy cleaning and storage.” — Sean “I’ve been meaning to recommend Mr. Owen Cutts on TikTok. He does something called Old Music Friday, and it’s awesome! He plays classic soul, R&B songs, and goes through what makes them great. But that’s not the best part — he gets so into the music he dances….. it’s just gotta be seen to enjoy.” — Brian “I recently started using ChatGPT to play a solo RPG. (Solo RPGs are games where you receive random events by rolling dice/drawing cards and then journaling what happens.) Rather than writing a few simple sentences of what happened, I have ChatGPT take my plot points and write a paragraph. Then, I use ElevenLabs to narrate the scene to me. It is honestly really fun.” — Albert Signing off One of my New Year’s resolutions this year is to scroll less and game more. I’m not trying to not waste time on my phone, I just want to waste that time in a way that makes me feel good and not bad. So that means lots of limits on social apps, and total free rein on the NYT Games app, Puzzmo, Balatro, and the rest of the places I can pour hours and hours of free time. This shift has, somewhat unexpectedly, made me absolutely love Apple Arcade. For $6.99 a month, I get a bunch of exclusive games and, more importantly, a lot of games without ads or in-app purchase shenanigans. As a result, I’m playing more games — and trying more new ones — than ever. I’ve even started playing Asphalt 8 again, which is much more fun when it’s not begging you for money all the time. Now I just have to remember how to stop crashing so much. See you next week!",2026-01-10T08:00:00-05:00,2026-01-10 20:45:09.951922
116,,,,,,,verge,https://www.theverge.com/games/859891/awesome-games-done-quick-2026-indie-games-small-saga,A charity speedrunning event has turned into a perfect showcase for smaller games,"is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities. Games Done Quick, the biannual charity speedrunning event currently going on right now, not only helps organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders — it helps indie games get noticed, too. Indie game developers face an incredible uphill battle not only getting their projects funded, completed, and launched, but discovered as well. Events like GDQ can be a boon to developers, exposing tens of thousands of viewers to little-known games like Bat to the Heavens, Small Saga, and more. “It was extremely exciting,” said Ceroro, developer of Bat to the Heavens, a platformer in which the character must ascend to the heavens using a bat because she cannot jump. Bat to the Heavens is Ceroro’s first official game and was released in 2024. It was featured during Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 and late last year at RTA in Japan. Ceroro said that while her game has been generally successful, getting on GDQ gave it a big boost. “Right after the AGDQ run, there was a large burst in sales and wishlists I haven’t seen since I initially released the game!” she said. Solo developer Darya Noghani said Small Saga, her turn-based RPG about a mouse who wants to kill god, got a nice uptick in attention after being featured at GDQ as well. “A number of streamers played the game on Twitch, several commenters recommended the game on platforms like Bluesky, and there was a nice uptick in sales,” they said. But the attention of getting your game run at a GDQ event can come with a price. “You’re in a state of apprehension,” said Noghani. Speedrunners extensively exploit glitches and develop techniques to skip large chunks of gameplay, which might show viewers a less-than-ideal version of the game. “Runners are pushing the game to break in particular ways, and you know this is adjacent to the game just crashing and ruining the run.” But Noghani also said that the Small Saga run was relatively glitch-free: “I’ll take that as a win.” Sometimes a runner breaking a game is what the developer had in mind. “Exploits and glitches are something that taps into the nature of game design,” Ceroro said. While the Bat to the Heavens run also didn’t make extensive use of glitches, “A lot of the extreme movement and techniques used in the run are pretty much within bounds of the intended design,” she said. Ceroro’s also not worried that watching a speedrun of Bat to the Heavens will spoil the game for potential new players. “The speedrun for Bat to the Heavens went by too fast to actually get a good understanding of everything or how the game actually feels, so it’ll be a shock to new players,” she said. Thanks to GDQ, new players are coming. But while all the developers I spoke to were pleased with the newfound attention and increased sales, they also said the personal achievement of getting their game run at GDQ was just as important. “It’s been exciting,” said Noghani. “Because GDQ is genuinely well-loved by both players and developers, not just for its charitable causes, but because of the efforts they’ve taken to cultivate an uplifting community.” GDQ is much beloved in the online gaming community. Over the years, event runners have implemented a top-down approach to diversity and inclusion, hosting several smaller events focused on highlighting streamers from marginalized backgrounds. GDQ has also fostered a community where saying “trans rights” elicits the same kind of enthusiastic response that an OSU alum would get shouting “O-H” in a crowded Columbus bar. “In the development community, it’s a giant moment,” said Xalavier Nelson Jr., creative director at Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator developer Strange Scaffold, which has had its games featured in GDQ events. “I got about as many congratulations for appearing on Games Done Quick as I have for getting married. It’s that much of a touchstone — and that positive of an overall event and community.”",2026-01-10T08:00:00-05:00,2026-01-10 20:45:10.373981

Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI. Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed. Amazon could be taking another, even bigger swing at physical stores, this time with a Walmart-like supercenter. On Tuesday, the Orland Park Plan Commission in the Chicago suburb Orland Park, Illinois voted 6-1 to approve Amazon’s proposal to develop 35 acres of land for a 229,000-square foot retail center, as reported by The Information. The development would include a brick-and-mortar supercenter selling groceries, general merchandise, and prepared foods. It would also double as an Amazon fulfillment center, like a department store with an Amazon warehouse in back. Customers would be able to pick up Amazon orders there, as well. The proposed development is far from Amazon’s first attempt at launching a brick-and-mortar retail location. Over the past few years, it’s been closing its physical stores in droves. In 2022, it shuttered all 68 of its brick-and-mortar book stores, 4-star stores, and Pop Up shops. It also shut down both of its Amazon Style clothing stores in 2023. Recently, Amazon has been focusing its brick-and-mortar store efforts on Whole Foods Market, which Amazon purchased in 2017, but it looks like it still has physical store ambitions of its own.",2026-01-09T18:18:41-05:00,2026-01-10 20:45:11.185994

Good Night, and Good Luck: Live From Broadway A live recording of George Clooney’s Broadway debut, this stage play adapts Clooney’s 2005 film of the same name, centered on CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow and his on-air battles with Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. It’s not a beat-for-beat re-creation though—beyond Clooney stepping into the lead role of Murrow, it extends the original movie’s examination of the role of media and journalism right up to the present day, for a powerful contrast of McCarthy’s spurious Communist witch hunts with present day politics. Darkly, depressingly resonant, but a powerful piece of theater that’s now accessible without the hefty ticket price. Okja Before winning Oscars and cementing his name in the Hollywood firmament with Parasite, Bong Joon-ho had something of a sideline in creature features. While 2006's The Host remains worth hunting down, this 2017 saga of genetic engineering and animal exploitation may be the director’s pinnacle of the genre. After helping raise an enhanced “super pig” in rural South Korea, young Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun) is distraught when the American company behind its creation, Mirando, comes to take it back. Falling in with a group of Animal Liberation Front activists, Mija travels to Mirando’s headquarters in New York in a desperate effort to rescue her unlikely animal friend. Darkly satirical in places, Okja manages to explore themes of animal exploitation and environmental conservation without feeling preachy—and a dual-role from the ever-magnetic Tilda Swinton doesn’t hurt. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery The third installment in writer-director Rian Johnson’s Knives Out series finds master detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) investigating “a perfectly impossible crime.” This time, it’s the death of Monsignor Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin), whose firebrand preaching has alienated much of his small parish in upstate New York. All fingers point to junior priest Jud Duplenticy (Josh O'Connor), a “young, dumb, and full of Christ” former boxer with a dark past. Of course, with Johnson’s skilled pen, nothing is clear-cut, especially when Wicks’ own flock—a murderer’s row of acting royalty, including Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Kerry Washington, Glenn Close, and Thomas Haden Church—all seem to have their own motives. Although it takes a somewhat darker, more ponderous tone than its predecessors, Wake Up Dead Man still packs in a wry sense of humor and makes for a fantastic third outing for what might end up being Craig’s definitive onscreen role. (Shake that, James Bond.) Klaus First dropping on Netflix back in 2019, this BAFTA and Annie Award-winning animated masterpiece remains Netflix's finest festive outing. When spoiled Jesper Johansson is charged by his father, the powerful Postmaster General, with setting up a new post office in the isolated town of Smeerensburg, it seems impossible. With the community divided into two warring clans, the only thing residents send each other are frosty glares. Yet after crossing paths with surly woodsman Klaus, who has spent a lifetime carving toys, Jesper stumbles on a way to potentially bring the town together—and start a tradition in the process. While Christmas films teasing the origin of Santa are usually saccharine dives into schmaltzy sentimentality, Klaus offers a slightly darker take, from the murky, decrepit setting that evokes the unsettling vibes of A Series of Unfortunate Events to its version of the jolly gift-giver as an imposing, intimidating figure. Delivering plenty of heart along with its more mature tone, this almost otherworldly tale is a modern Christmas miracle. Troll 2 Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider) had ""Norwegian kaiju"" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating ""Megatroll"" it has locked away. Soon, Nora—reunited with allies Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Major Kris Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen)—is caught in another desperate race to prevent a trollpocalypse. This time though, there's an edge of Indiana Jones at work, with a madcap ancient conspiracy to decode alongside the troll-smashing action. Troll 2 is a bit more tongue-in-cheek than its predecessor, and ventures into so-bad-it's-good territory in places, but it knows exactly what it is and what it's offering: giant rock monsters beating the boulders off of each other. Don't overthink it and you'll have a smashing time. Behind the Curtain: Stranger Things—The First Shadow If you want to catch up on every facet of Stranger Things now that the fifth and final season is here, this fills in one gap that even binge-watching the entire show again won't: a behind-the-scenes documentary focused on production of the West End stage show The First Shadow. The film doesn't give the whole production away—though it's a prequel, set in 1959 and exploring how the sleepy town of Hawkins became ground zero for all things supernatural—but it's a fascinating look at the technical wizardry that went into bringing the show to life. It also explores how director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott, Netflix's The Crown) and legendary theater producer Sonia Friedman worked with the Duffer Brothers to root everything in the lore and history of the series, making this an important piece of the larger puzzle. A House of Dynamite If you knew an intercontinental ballistic missile was heading somewhere in middle America, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead, you'd probably hope that the US government and military would be on top of the situation. At the very least, you'd expect them to know who launched the strike, from where, and how to intercept it. In A House of Dynamite, the most terrifying thing is how much might not be known in such a nightmarish scenario, and how the very systems we think will protect us from nuclear war might not be up to the job. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker) and featuring a powerhouse cast including Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts, and Anthony Ramos, this triptych explores the same nightmarish 18 minutes after an unidentified missile is detected from three different perspectives, each chapter likely filling you with mounting existential dread. The film that pissed off the Pentagon, this political thriller is absolutely not for the faint-hearted. Brick When workaholic game developer Tim (Matthias Schweighöfer, Army of the Dead) and his partner Liv (Ruby O. Fee) break up, Liv finds it hard to walk away. Quite literally, as their apartment block has been mysteriously surrounded by an impenetrable barrier. Left with no choice but to smash through walls and ceilings to find a way out, teaming with other residents trapped inside as they do, the group desperately searches for an escape route—but the strange blockade and the building itself seems set on stopping them. Reminiscent at times of cult classic Cube, this German language sci-fi thriller (there's an English language dub, but it's truly terrible—stick with subtitles) is schlocky but satisfying entertainment. Frankenstein Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited take on Mary Shelley’s foundational work of science fiction is finally here—and it’s worth the wait. You all know the tale: Hubristic, obsessed Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac) seeks to conquer death itself, but in animating his chimeric Creature (Jacob Elordi), he sows the seeds of his own demise. But del Toro's vision, awash with absolutely sumptuous set and costume design, and bolstered by a phenomenal expanded cast (notably Charles Dance as Victor's cruel father and Mia Goth in a dual role that adds a twisted perspective to Victor's motivations) brings the story to life like never before. It's instantly among del Toro's best works. The Twits Plenty of married couples bicker, but Mrs. Twit (Margo Martindale) and Mr. Twit (British comedian Johnny Vegas) hate each other. They only seem to stay together to bring their twisted theme park Twitlandia to life. But when their efforts go disastrously awry, it's left to orphans Beesha (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) and Bubsy (Ryan Lopez) and the mystical Muggle-Wumps to take down the wicked pair. Director Phil Johnston's (Ralph Breaks the Internet) take on Roald Dahl's dark children's tale is a world away from the original (and wisely jettisons some of the problematic elements of the source material), but despite keeping plenty of crass humor, it becomes surprisingly—if not subtly—political amidst the gross-out gags. One for younger viewers, but with enough wit to entertain older ones too. The Blackening When a group of Black college friends hold a reunion for Juneteenth, the vibe seems off. For starters, they’re meeting at a cabin in the woods, which is a little too close to horror movie territory. Such genre-savviness begins to pay off when they discover a suspicious board game in the basement and find themselves playing by a serial killer’s twisted rules—starting with determining the “Blackest” member of the group to sacrifice. With a cast of comedy greats including X Mayo, Jermaine Fowler, and Jay Pharoah, The Blackening is a self-aware and smartly satirical twist on horror movie conventions that brilliantly plays on its tongue-in-cheek tagline: “We can’t all die first.” Packing in just the right level of scares to avoid going full parody, this is perfect Halloween viewing. The Running Man In an America that has become a totalitarian police state, the corrupt government maintains power through propaganda and control of communication, making those it deems criminals fight for their freedom in a lethal game show that has replaced true justice. That’s in the dystopian “future” of 2017 though, where Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the latest victim of the system, forced to compete after being framed for a series of murders. Released in 1987, The Running Man finds Arnie at his cheesiest, delivering one-liners while killing outlandish goons with panache. While it loses a lot of the satire and cultural warnings of the original Stephen King novel, this action classic remains an entertaining watch, and well worth a look ahead of the upcoming remake, directed by Edgar Wright, which looks set to stick closer to the source material. Mantis Set in the same universe as Kill Bok-soon, this Korean action extravaganza shifts focus to contract killer Lee Han-ul (Yim Si-wan), better known as Mantis, who returns from a vacation—even assassins need a break—to find the violent world in which he operates in chaos. The shadowy organization MK ENT has fallen, leaving no one to enforce the honor rules that once governed the profession, but more importantly, creating a power vacuum to be filled. As Mantis aims to take control and restore order, his complicated relationship with ally/rival(/love interest?) Shin Jae-yi (Park Gyu-young) threatens to make everything a thousand times worse. While it takes a lighter tone than Kill Bok-soon, leaning more on comedy than action, Mantis serves up phenomenal fight choreography and sizzling chemistry between its leads, making for a solid spinoff. Devo Listen up, you spuds—Devo were more than a bunch of kooks wearing energy dome hats. The accidentally iconic band were pioneers of New Wave music, practically invented the concept of the music video, and did it all while sending polite society into a panic. Directed by master documentarian Chris Smith, this insightful film charts the rise of the band, from their formation in the wake of the Kent State shootings of 1970 through to becoming one of the most overtly political rock groups in history—even as their commentary on the devolution of mass culture was often lost on their listeners. The Thursday Murder Club In the picturesque retirement community of Coopers Chase, the Thursday Murder Club—former union leader Ron (Pierce Brosnan), psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley), nurse Joyce (Celia Imrie) and de facto leader Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), a retired MI6 officer—meets each week to share their theories on cold cases. It’s all grim fun and games until one of Coopers Chase’s owners is murdered on their doorstep—right after opposing plans to redevelop the community as part of a luxury property deal. But as the club puts their not-so-amateur sleuthing skills to the test, they all emerge as suspects. Based on the series of novels by Richard Osman, and with a killer cast of British and Irish acting royalty, this is a cozy crime caper to die for. Mononoke the Movie II: The Ashes of Rage Set a month after the events of The Phantom in the Rain, the second in a planned trilogy finds the mysterious Medicine Seller returning to the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace in Edo-era Japan. While conditions for the emperor’s lower-ranking concubines have improved, prickly political machinations make things more dangerous than ever for the upper tier, including warring favorites Fuki and Botan—and that’s before a new supernatural terror raises its head. Another masterclass in tension and otherworldly horror, Mononoke maintains its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, making for one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see. Ziam There’s a lot to recommend about Ziam, but the elevator pitch is just four words: Muay Thai versus zombies. The literal translation of the Thai title gives us four more: “Biting Mouth, Kicking Feet.” If that doesn’t make you want to watch this action-horror outing, seek help. Set in an already dystopian future where the climate crisis has melted the ice caps, former professional fighter Singh (Prin Suparat) is desperate to reunite with his girlfriend Rin (Nuttanicha Dungwattanawanich), a doctor in his hometown of Chiang Dao. Cue one zombie outbreak courtesy of the shady VS Corporation, and soon Singh is punching, kicking, and elbowing his way through hordes of ravenous undead, trying to evacuate Rin and a young patient from her hospital—before it’s blown up to contain the infection! Think Ong Bak meets Dawn of the Dead meets The Raid, and throw in some of the most horrifying zombie designs in years, and Ziam makes for a schlocky but thrilling time. KPop Demon Hunters Three-part harmony group Huntr/x are at the top of their game. Not only are they the world's best-loved girl group, but in their secret side role as Earth's defenders against demonic forces, they're about to permanently seal away an ancient evil. Unfortunately, lead singer Rumi (Arden Cho) is hiding something from bandmates Mira (May Hong) and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), and her dark secret may tear them apart right as they face their strongest foes—an evil boyband fronted by the devilishly handsome Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop). Blending the pastel-pop of Jem and the Holograms, the monster-slaying action of Buffy, and enough K-pop earworms to make Blackpink blink, Kpop Demon Hunters is a perfect summer movie for kids and families, a brilliantly animated adventure that's as fresh and memorable as its energetic musical numbers. Our Times In 1966, husband and wife physicists Nora (Lucero) and Héctor (Benny Ibarra) are equal partners at the University of Mexico, even though their colleagues see Nora as little more than Héctor's lab assistant. Then they crack the secret of time travel, catapulting themselves forward to 2025—and strand themselves here. While both marvel at the leaps humanity has made in half a century, Nora is delighted to be reunited with her former protégé Julia (Ofelia Medina), now dean of the university. But as Héctor finds himself desperate to return to the comfort and prestige he enjoyed in the past, the pair's relationship begins to fall apart. More rom-com than sci-fi, this is time-travel with a bittersweet touch. Lost in Starlight Dr. Nan-young Joo is desperate to follow in her late astronaut mother's footsteps and make it all the way to Mars. Jay is a slacker part-timer, loosely aspiring to be a musician. In this Korean animated movie from director Han Ji-won, they become a pair of literally star-crossed lovers, linked by a love of music. While the sci-fi aspect of it all makes for some spectacular visuals, from the futuristic-but-plausible view of Seoul in 2051, to truly cosmic, almost psychedelic, sequences as Nan-young ventures into space, the story's heart lies in the quieter, meaningful moments between its leads. Absolutely exquisite. Kill Boksoon To her friends, Gil Bok-soon (Jeon Do-yeon) is a successful events executive and dedicated single mother to her daughter Jae-yeong (Kim Si-a). In reality, she's the star performer at MK Ent—an assassination bureau, where her almost superhuman ability to predict every step in a critical situation has earned her a 100 percent success rate and a legendary reputation. The only problem: She's considering retiring at the end of her contract, a decision that opens her to threats from disgruntled enemies and ambitious colleagues alike. While its title and premise not-so-subtly evokes Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, director Byun Sung-hyun takes this Korean action epic to giddy heights with some of the most impressive fights committed to screen since, well, Kill Bill. Bullet Train Explosion Kazuya Takaichi (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi) is conductor of the Hayabusa 60 shinkansen, zooming from Shin-Aomori to Tokyo. A perfectly normal job—until a terrorist reveals a bomb onboard, which will explode if the train slows below 100 kmph. As authorities race to stop the attacker and rescue the passengers, Kazuya is forced to keep everyone onboard safe. What's that? It's just Speed on a Japanese train? Nah, Speed was just the original 1975 The Bullet Train on an American bus—and this modern-day version is equal parts remake and sequel to that Sonny Chiba-starring classic. It's more than an entertaining action thriller, though—director Shinji Higuchi relishes the opportunity to poke fun at point-scoring politicians crippled by bureaucratic process in responding to the crisis (no surprise to anyone who's seen 2016's Shin Godzilla, which he codirected with Hideaki Anno). High-speed, literally explosive action, with a satirical edge, Bullet Train Explosion is a blast (sorry). The Imaginary This gorgeously animated take on the concept of imaginary friends is a whimsical fable full of stunning visuals and big ideas. Adapted from the book by A. F. Harrold, The Imaginary follows young Amanda and her best friend Rudger—brought into being by her own mind—as they share countless adventures. But as Amanda ages, Rudger faces the fate of all Imaginaries: fading away as their humans forget them. The latest film from director Yoshiyuki Momose (Mary and the Witch’s Flower) and Studio Ponoc—spiritual successor to the mighty Studio Ghibli—this is a stunning ode to the power of imagination and friendship. Dead Talents Society When keeping the living terrified is the economy of the afterlife, death becomes a literal capitalist hellhole. Dead Talents Society sees warring ""ghostresses"" Catherine (Sandrine Pinna) and her former protégé Jessica (Eleven Yao) battling for glamour and prestige in the great beyond by innovating new ways of scaring mortals, while a newcomer known only as Rookie (Gingle Wang) struggles to make her mark with any scares at all—and risks fading away entirely if she can't earn her undead keep. A sharply satirical horror comedy poking fun at everything from reality TV to hustle culture, this Taiwanese outing from writer-director John Hsu beats Beetlejuice at its own game. Leave the World Behind A weekend getaway at a luxury vacation rental property for Amanda and Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose, takes a sinister turn in the wake of an inexplicable blackout. When the house's owner, George, and his daughter Ruth return early, suspicions mount—but a growing herd of deer lurking outside the house, failing vehicles, and scattered reports of attacks across the US force the two families to rely on each other in the face of what may be the end of the world. Adapted from the novel of same name by Rumaan Alam, and with a star-studded cast including Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la, and Kevin Bacon, this relishes in keeping the audiences as uncertain as its characters, explaining little, and leaving questions you'll be mulling for days. Troll This gleefully entertaining giant monster movie abandons tearing up Tokyo or New York in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (2018's Tomb Raider) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. Although the plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema, the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape, allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into near-parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers, and with a sequel arriving in December, now is the perfect time to revisit one of the freshest takes on the genre in years. Y Tu Mamá También It's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity. Parasite Director Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever. Carry-On Is a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain. Joy In vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now. Woman of the Hour A serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long. Will & Harper Will Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced. His Three Daughters As their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming. Grave of the Fireflies When Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films. Rebel Ridge When corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch. Under Paris This so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy. Godzilla Minus One Despite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side. Suzume Suzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy. Rustin Directed by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself. His House Fleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters. Eldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate Centered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of. They Cloned Tyrone Drug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch. Nimona Shapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic. Cargo In a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world. Call Me Chihiro An idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery Daniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year. The Wonder Florence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak. RRR One of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed. I Lost My Body An award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all. Don’t Look Up Frustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:12.990742
121,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/review/fujifilm-xe5-mirrorless-camera/,Fujifilm X-E5 Mirrorless Camera Review: Compact Color Science in a Retro Package,"Fujifilm's X-E5 was released toward the end of 2025, and like all Fujifilm cameras, it was difficult to get your hands on at first. It delivers much of what it promises, being essentially an interchangeable-lens version of the extremely popular Fujifilm X100VI. If you want a cute, compact X100VI, but want to switch lenses from time to time (or constantly, if that's your thing), this is absolutely the camera for you. Like other cameras with this sensor, images are fantastic, micro-contrast is great, and Fujiflim's color science is excellent as always. I have a couple of minor gripes with some design choices, but for the most part, the X-E5 is exactly the camera that fans of the X-E series have been waiting for. Could I live without the film simulation dial? Yes, yes I could. But no camera is perfect. The 40-MP Rangefinder Photograph: Scott Gilbertson The X-E series cameras used to be Fujifilm's minimalist range finder—a smaller, lighter, cheaper alternative to the X-Pro series. I would argue that with this fifth version of the X-E, this is no longer true. This is the Fujifilm range finder. It's less minimalist, both in terms of features and in size and weight, and if no one else is willing to say it I will: There aren't going to be any more X-Pros. If you want a range finder from Fujifilm, the X-E5 is the camera to get. The X-E5 is technically the sixth X-E camera since Fujifilm sneaked the X-E2S in between the X-E2 and 3, but let's not be pedantic. We'll just say this is the fifth iteration of the X-E, and it is both the best X-E yet and also a little disappointing. Let's start with what's not disappointing: the 40-megapixel APC-C X-Trans V sensor and processor. Together, as we've seen in both the X-T5 and X100VI, this combo of sensor and processor is capable of producing truly great photos and is the first sensor from Fujifilm that doesn't make me miss my full-frame cameras.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:13.516854

Run Away The latest entry in Netflix’s deal to adapt just about everything Harlan Coben writes down, Run Away features James Nesbitt as Simon Greene, a father desperate to bring his troubled daughter Paige (Ellie de Lange) home. But when Paige’s drug dealer boyfriend Aaron (Thomas Flynn) turns up dead—an event that happened not too long after a video of Simon beating him up in public went viral—Simon has to dodge a murder investigation while being drawn deeper into mysteries surrounding the missing Paige. Run Away doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to crime dramas, but with a solid cast and plenty of twists and surprises through its eight episodes, it’s perfect binge viewing for the long, cold winter. His & Hers Based on Alice Feeney’s crime novel of the same name, His & Hers is a glossy affair, fronted by Jon Bernthal and Tessa Thompson as small-town detective Jack Harper and his estranged reporter wife Anna. Following the death of their daughter, Anna left Jack to care for her mother Alice (Crystal Fox) while throwing herself into work. The pair are reunited during the investigation of a murder and ultimately become suspects as connections to the dead woman emerge. It’s soapy at times, but the exploration of how grief can shatter lives gives Thompson and Bernthal plenty to work with, and delivers some unpredictable narrative swerves along the way. City of Shadows This Spanish crime thriller plays with a lot of genre conventions—a disgraced cop, Milo Malart (Isak Férriz), forced to prove himself again; the frosty relationship with a new female partner, Rebeca Garrido (Verónica Echegui), brought in from another department; a maze of clues and conspiracy elements—but gets a distinct twist thanks to its Barcelona setting. When a series of ritualistic murders spreads across the city, seemingly tied to the architecture of Antoni Gaudí, the city itself becomes a character in a sprawling and increasingly bizarre case. The English-dubbed version leaves a lot to be desired, but the original Spanish audio and English subtitles are available, and make for the perfect way to enjoy this twisty, pulpy limited series. Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Bridging the gap between the modern Tomb Raider prequel games and the events of the original 1990s outings, The Legend of Lara Croft finds the iconic treasure hunter (voiced by Hayley Atwell) still growing into her role as a globe-trotting adventurer. Grappling with her own traumatic past while forging bonds with vital allies, this animated outing finds Lara searching for ancient artifacts with a personal connection to her own family, and hunting down powerful masks that channel world-changing powers. Throw in a few encounters with meddling spirits and angry gods, and Lara’s in for some of the toughest battles of her life—and this is a woman who’s canonically fought T-rexes armed only with a pair of pistols. A must-watch for fans of the games, and an action-packed thrill ride even for those who’ve never picked up a controller in their life. Stranger Things After what feels like a thousand years trapped in the Upside Down (although in reality only three and a half), Stranger Things is back for its fifth and final season. Following the reality-tearing events of Stranger Things 4, the residents of Hawkins are now under military quarantine, but not everyone is taking it laying down. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is secretly training her powers, aided by adoptive parents Hopper (David Harbour) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), while Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), and the rest of the adventuring party are organizing an underground movement to hunt down demonic big-bad Vecna. But when Mike's young sister Holly (Nell Fisher) is dragged into the Upside Down by a Demogorgon, it raises one major question—just why was Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) kidnapped at the very start of the show, instigating the wave of horror that's consumed Hawkins since? The Beast in Me Author Aggie Wiggs (Clare Danes) is struggling on her next book—but when property magnate Nile Jarvis (Matthew Rhys) moves into the neighborhood, still dogged by lingering accusations that he murdered his first wife, the perfect subject may be right next door. Although she initially rejects his suggestion to write about him, Aggie is drawn ever deeper into the darkly charismatic Nile's world in the wake of another suspicious death, one with a deeply personal connection to her own tragic past. While The Beast in Me boasts phenomenal performances from its wider cast—including Natalie Morales as Aggie's ex-wife Shelley and Brittany Snow as Nile's new wife Nina, who may have her own secrets—it's the increasingly tense and deeply psychologically twisted connection that forms between Danes' and Rhys' characters that makes it impossible to look away from this eight-episode thriller. Last Samurai Standing Set in late 1800s Japan, Last Samurai Standing follows retired samurai Shujiro Saga (Junichi Okada), who enters the savage ""Kodoku"" tournament in a desperate effort to save his family, struck down by cholera. The problem is, he's one of 292 former samurai aiming to win the ¥100,000 prize, and the only way to progress through the competition is to collect tags from fallen enemies and pass through checkpoints set up by the event's mysterious organizers. It's going to be a bloodbath. Based on the series of Japanese novels written by Shogo Imamura and illustrated by Katsumi Tatsuzawa, this packs in some of the finest sword duels and martial arts sequences ever committed to the screen, all while exploring the rapidly changing face of Japanese society after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Think Squid Game set in Meiji era Japan, and you're scratching the surface of this thrilling six-episode miniseries. Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Netflix's roster of adult animation adds another hit with this spin-off of Ubisoft's spy action series. Set years after the events of the games, Deathwatch finds grizzled veteran Sam Fisher (Liev Schreiber) dragged out of retirement to rescue a younger agent, Zinnia McKenna (Kirby Howell-Baptiste, known mononymously as Kirby), after one of her own missions goes grievously wrong. It's a dark and gritty affair, both tonally and visually—the animation is handled by a cohort of Danish and French studios, giving it more a bande dessinée look rather than aping anime—boasting top-notch action throughout. What else would you expect though, given the show was developed for screen by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad? Already renewed for a second season, this brutal epic is only getting started. The Witcher Almost everything is different in The Witcher’s fourth season. Gone is former leading man Henry Cavill, with Liam Hemsworth donning the gray wig as monster-slaying Geralt of Rivia in his place. It's been a controversial switch, but Hemsworth holds his own well enough, despite being perhaps a bit too cautious in his portrayal. However, this latest chapter in the fantasy epic, based on the novels of Andrzej Sapkowski, really belongs to sorceress Yennefer (the returning Anya Chalotra), gathering forces against the dark mage Vilgefortz (Mahesh Jadu), and trainee Witcher Ciri (Freya Allen), seeking a new life for herself with a group of thieves called the Rats. While the core trio's tales barely intersect this season, the distance allows each to stand on their own strengths. It also sets the stage for greater things to come in the fifth and final season. This Cavill-less Witcher might take some getting used to, but if you've been watching since the beginning, it's definitely worth sticking around. Boots Adapted from Greg Cope White’s memoir The Pink Marine, this eight-episode series follows closeted teen Cameron Cope (Miles Heizer) as he follows his friend Ray (Liam Oh) into the US Marine Corps—even as his mother Barbara (Vera Farmiga) barely notices him leaving. Picking up in 1990—before “Don't Ask, Don't Tell”—Boots walks the fine line between drama and comedy as it charts Cameron's fish-out-of-water travails through basic training. While it could all have easily devolved into a collection of tropes, the series instead serves up a smart exploration of masculinity and camaraderie that can feel surprisingly tender at times, while never pulling its punches when it comes to the conditions recruits can face. Wayward Wayward was created by comedian Mae Martin, but don’t expect a laugh riot in this dark and distressing thriller. The series focuses on the secretive Tall Pines Academy in Vermont, a boarding school for troubled teens, ruled with an iron fist by self-styled savior Evelyn Wade (a chillingly commanding Toni Collette). Except, to the outside world, Wade is a caring pillar of the community, helping desperate youths—a dichotomy that the school’s latest residents, Abbie (Sydney Topliffe) and Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind), are about to brutally experience firsthand. Their only hope may be Alex (Martin), a newly transferred cop who grows suspicious of the hold Wade has over both the town and Laura (Sarah Gadon), Alex’s wife who is herself a graduate of Tall Pines. Despite having the vibe of a docudrama, Wayward is entirely fictional—but its exploration of control, coercion, and the power of charismatic figures feels all too real. House of Guinness If you’re a fan of a pint of the black stuff—that’s famed Irish stout beer Guinness for the nondrinkers out there—this historical drama based on the family behind its creation will go down smooth. When patriarch Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness dies, he leaves behind one of the largest and most powerful businesses in Ireland, setting the stage for a war of succession between his four children. With control left to eldest sons Arthur (Anthony Boyle) and Edward (Louis Partridge), but nothing for daughter Anne (Emily Fairn), and only a token trust fund for Benjamin Jr. (Fionn O’Shea), the wealthiest family in Ireland is about to go to war—right as the company is trying to expand into New York. Is it 100 percent authentic to the period or settings? About as accurate as creator Steven Knight’s Peaky Blinders was to early 20th century Birmingham, England—which is to say, not exactly, but the mix of drama, betrayal, and politics is a hell of a lot of fun all the same. Sláinte! Haunted Hotel When Katherine inherited the dilapidated Undervale Hotel from her late brother Nathan, she didn't expect he'd still be ra esident there—but anyone who dies at the Undervale never checks out, so he's hanging around as a ghost. Now Katherine is stuck trying to manage a failing business, keep a few centuries’ worth of squabbling specters happy, and stop her kids Ben and Esther from dabbling in the dark arts—all while Abaddon, a demon trapped in a pilgrim child's body, keeps trying to get his infernal powers back. Created by Rick and Morty writer Matt Roller, Haunted Hotel starts off as a seemingly familiar addition to Netflix's roster of original adult animated series but manages to interrupt its spooky hijinks with some unexpectedly profound and emotionally resonant moments. With a voice cast boasting comedy greats Will Forte and Eliza Coupe, Haunted Hotel is worth digging up this Halloween. Alice in Borderland When slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) was mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills turned out to be an edge in navigating a series of lethal games that tested intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after finally escaping and starting a new life with Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), the newly arrived third and final season finds Arisu drawn back into the Borderland for one final round of brutal games—with the lives of everyone he cares about on the line. Going beyond the material laid down in Haro Aso's original manga was a risky decision, but it pays off in this last batch of six episodes, serving up some of the most inventive and thrilling challenges in the series' history while tying up some long-running character arcs. Black Rabbit The Black Rabbit is on its way to being New York’s hottest restaurant, an ultra-cool eatery that’s one glowing New York Times review away from blowing up. Proprietor Jake Friedken (Jude Law) has poured everything into it—so it’s the absolute worst time for his screw-up brother Vince (Jason Bateman) to crawl back into his life. On the run from a hit-and-run in Reno, and with long-standing debts to the mob hanging over him, Vince’s reappearance threatens to drag Jake down, and pushes brotherly love to lethal limits. Created by writers Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, this eight-episode limited series blends The Bear and Breaking Bad into a deliciously tense thriller that leaves you wanting a second course. Wolf King Based on the Wereworld books by Curtis Jobling, this animated fantasy adventure follows young farmer Drew (Cel Spellman), whose life is thrown into chaos when he learns he’s actually the hidden son of the lost Wolf King. Being the Wolf King's hidden son means he's also the last threat to the rule of King Leopold, the werelion who has stolen the throne. Joined by reluctant allies Whitley (Nina Barker Francis) and Hector (Chris Lew Kum Hoi), Drew is thrust into a quest to master his lupine powers and claim the crown he’s destined for—if they can evade Leopold’s forces. While the animation style won’t be for everyone—a pseudo-stop-motion approach—Wolf King will capture fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Dragon Prince, and its balance of swords and sorcery and savage werebeasts gives it just enough bite for parents and older viewers. Long Story Short Adult animation is awash with family sitcoms—The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob’s Burgers, on and on—but they’re all stuck in the perma-present, mixing outlandish events with a never-changing status quo. Not so for Long Story Short, the latest series from BoJack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg. The show follows the thoroughly pedestrian antics of the Schwoopers, jumping between the 1950s and 2020s as it does so. As it ricochets through the lives of parents Naomi and Elliot, and their children Avi, Shira, and Yoshi, it proves itself as a series that balances finding comedy in the mundane—from chaotic bar mitzvahs to anniversaries-turned-interventions—with Waksberg’s penchant for the poignant woven throughout, all brought to life by a fantastic voice cast including Ben Feldman, Abbi Jacobson, and Nicole Byer. Already renewed for a second season, this is one story Netflix hasn’t cut short. Hostage With the UK in the midst of a health crisis, prime minister Abigail Dalton (Suranne Jones) is keen to strike a deal for medicine from French president Vivienne Toussaint (Julie Delpy)—standard politics, until Dalton’s husband Alex (Ashley Thomas), a doctor working with Medicins san Frontieres, is kidnapped in French Guiana. With the kidnappers demanding the PM’s resignation, the professional and the personal dangerously blur, while a conspiracy threatens Toussaint’s own position. Tense and masterfully paced, and with striking performances from Jones and Delpy, this five-episode limited series is an excellent political thriller to binge. Wednesday After spending the summer honing her psychic powers by tracking down serial killers, Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) returns to Nevermore Academy—but this school year is more of an Addams Family reunion. With her mother, Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), drawn into an onsite committee role by suspicious new principal Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi), brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez) joining the school after developing electric powers, and eccentric Grandmama (Joanna Lumley) turning up, Wednesday barely has a chance to investigate a new string of murders or a conspiracy surrounding a shady psychiatric hospital. The perils of the show’s protracted three-year gap between seasons is hard to overlook in places—Pugsley now towers over Wednesday, explained as a growth spurt, and you’ll almost certainly need to rewatch the first season to remember what’s going on—but this is a welcome return for Netflix’s spooky, ooky teen drama. Love, Death + Robots Developed by Deadpool director Tim Miller, Love, Death + Robots is one of Netflix’s most exciting animated offerings—an anthology series where the only common thread is each episode’s unique interpretation of that eponymous trio of themes. Now in its fourth season, viewers are treated to wild concepts that include psychic street gangs in a postapocalyptic future (400 Boys), a re-creation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Live at Slane Castle performance of “Can’t Stop” in marionette form (directed by David Fincher, no less), and, in a rare hybrid of live action and CGI, a priest (played by Rhys Darby) meeting an alien envoy that thinks God has been reborn as an Earth dolphin. Wildly experimental, Love, Death + Robots constantly juggles animation styles and genres and practically vibrates off the screen with sheer visual energy. You never know what you’re going to get with this show—and that’s half the fun. Sneaky Pete Just released from prison, Marius (Giovanni Ribisi) steals the identity of former cellmate Pete Murphy in order to hide from the dangers of his old life. On the run from a vicious gangster played by Bryan Cranston (who also jointly created the show), Marius nestles in with Pete’s motley crew of estranged family. They're delighted to be reunited with their long-lost relative, but he finds taking over another man’s life might be even more dangerous than the past he’s running from. Originally an Amazon Prime series, this three-season drama can now be binged in its entirety on Netflix. Grace and Frankie The brainchild of Friends cocreator Marta Kauffman, this sharp sitcom sees Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as the titular Grace and Frankie, longtime acquaintances forced into living together after their husbands leave them late in life—for each other. The show follows this contemporary odd couple as they deal with their ex-husbands' coming out, their adult children's drama, and each other's maddening personalities, all while building a genuine friendship and trying to prove to themselves and the world that age is just a number. Taking cues from Arrested Development, Grace and Frankie's chief comedic currency is awkwardness, as their two extended families—the rich, business-minded Hansons and the borderline hippy Bergsteins—bring their neuroses and baggage to bear while navigating adult familial relationships. Think of it as a modern-day Golden Girls—just with more swearing and drug use. Sakamoto Days Taro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hitman par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he's let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict ""no killing"" rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy action anime is a blast. Now into its second season, with new episodes dropping each Monday, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss. Squid Game The Korean sensation that became a global phenomenon, Squid Game’s blend of Hunger Games’ shocking elimination battles and Parasite’s condemnation of exploitative capitalism turned it into one of Netflix's biggest-ever hits. It started off simply enough—hundreds of desperate people recruited to compete in a series of playground games with a deadly twist, the survivor winning a ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot. But now, with its third and final season, the stakes are higher than ever, and even perennial survivor Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) might not be able to win this round. Intense, brutal, and frequently graphic, Squid Game remains gripping to the very end. Trainwreck Little else is as fascinating as a real-life disaster born of sheer hubris. The strange mix of “saw that one coming” and “get the popcorn,” as you watch events unfold makes for captivating viewing. That's the special sauce for Trainwreck, Netflix's series of documentaries exploring some of the biggest, well, train wrecks of recent history. From the crack-cocaine-fueled tenure of Toronto's disgraced mayor Rob Ford to the avoidable errors that saw a luxury cruise liner turned into an infamous “poop cruise,” each installment is a fascinating exploration of how badly things can go wrong when the wrong people are in charge. Netflix oddly categorizes each Trainwreck as its own movie, but it's really a loosely connected anthology, and while some cases require their own multi-episode arcs to excavate the wreckage (shoutout to Woodstock ’99), there's no particular starting point—simply pick your favorite screw-up and just try to look away. The Survivors Years ago, Kieran Elliott (Charlie Vickers) survived a storm that trapped him in a sea cave, but his brother Finn and friend Toby died in the rescue attempt. Fifteen years later, he returns to his hometown with his partner Mia (Yerin Ha) and their baby Audrey for a memorial, finding that everyone from neighbors to his own mother still blame him for the tragedy. While those deaths still haunt the small town community, they may also have obscured another tragedy—teenager Gabby Birch went missing the same night. Now, out-of-town investigator Bronte (Shannon Berry), the only person who still cared about the long-cold case, has wound up dead herself, and everyone in Kieran's life seems to be connected. Adapted from the novel by Jane Harper, this Australian murder mystery from Glitch creator Tony Ayres is a darkly compelling miniseries. Dept. Q Edinburgh police detective Carl Morck (The Crown's Matthew Goode) used to be one of the best—until his arrogance got his partner paralyzed and a uniformed officer killed, and saw him narrowly survive a bullet through his own neck. After returning to work following a lengthy period of mandatory leave, Morck finds himself heading up the new Department Q—an underfunded, under-staffed operation in the precinct's dank basement, dedicated to solving the iciest of cold cases. Gathering a team of misfits, including Rose (Leah Byrne), eager to please but recovering from a breakdown, Akram (Alexej Manvelov), a Syrian refugee, and Morck's still-bedbound partner James (Jamie Sives), the department has a lot to prove—but solving the disappearance of Merritt Linguard (Chloe Pirrie) might be a good start. Based on the novels by Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen, Dept. Q is a brilliant blend of Scandi noir and gritty British crime drama. Sirens First The White Lotus, then The Perfect Couple, and now Sirens—Meghann Fahy is making a career out of starring in shows where we get to see awfully rich people doing awfully bad things to each other. Here, she plays down-on-her-luck Devon, drawn into the luxurious world her sister Simone (Milly Alcock, imminently Supergirl) inhabits by proxy, working as an assistant to billionaire's wife Michaela (Julianne Moore). It's never clear how willingly Simone got involved with the charismatic Michaela, who may be a mentor or cult leader or something else entirely, nor how overprotective or paranoid Devon is, but the hook of this glossy, dark comedy is in finding out. Blood of Zeus This adult animated take on Greek mythology returns for its third and final season, bringing the odyssey of demigod Heron—son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra—to a brutal conclusion. After years of manipulation, power plays, and betrayals, the season picks up with the Olympian gods and their Titan predecessors lined up against each other, the fate of the world hanging on the outcome of the ultimate family feud. Heron and his estranged brother Seraphim may be the only ones able to bring peace—so it's rather inconvenient that Heron is dead. From start to finish, Blood of Zeus has impressed with smart writing that offers compelling twists on the classic myths, all brought to life with top-tier animation and phenomenal voice acting, and it doesn't disappoint as it reaches its finale. One of Netflix's best animated series. You Based on the novels of Caroline Kepnes, You is an often deeply disturbing series. During the first season, bookstore manager Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) falls in deranged-love-at-first-sight with aspiring author Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail). In subsequent ones, he relocates to Los Angeles, where heiress Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) became the focus of his attention, and then to London, where he poses as an unassuming university professor before meeting his match in Kate Galvin (Charlotte Ritchie). At each turn, the globe-hopping saga of murderous obsession has become more and more unsettling. In the fifth and final season, Joe returns to New York with his new wife, Kate, but the darkness and brutality that's followed him around the world is never far behind. Often shocking, You is a gripping thriller that hits the same sinister sweet spot as early (read: good) seasons of Dexter. Black Mirror Black Mirror returns with six new episodes that continue to explore humanity’s complicated relationship with technology. Although the new, seventh season includes a couple of rare sequels to previous Black Mirror episodes, the anthology format means every episode remains accessible. That means you can jump right in with the heartbreaking “Eulogy,” where Paul Giamatti's Phillip dives through his own fractured memories of a lost lover. Or you can start with the sinister “Plaything,” in which a gaming journalist gets murderously obsessed with a strange life-sim game, partly inspired by series creator Charlie Brooker’s own background. (In a very meta twist, you can play the game for real.) Whether you’re a longtime fan or this is your first encounter with poignant tech dystopias, all of Black Mirror awaits your viewing. North of North Young Inuk woman Siaja (Anna Lambe, True Detective: Night Country) married straight out of high school, then spent years trapped in the shadow of her shallow, selfish husband, Ting—the golden boy of their small town of Ice Cove, nestled far in the Arctic Circle. A brush with death—and possibly the goddess Nuliajuk—gives her the push to make a fresh start, but an explosive breakup in a community of only 2,000 people means Siaja’s personal life is now everyone’s business. Netflix’s first Canadian original series, this sharp sitcom is packed with warmth and humor, while its on-location shooting in Iqaluit (the real-life capital of the Arctic Canadian territory of Nunavut) delivers breathtaking natural beauty along with the laughs. Devil May Cry Building on the success of Castlevania, Netflix’s take on Capcom’s Devil May Cry series continues the streamer’s strong track record of animated video game adaptations. For those who've never picked up a controller, the series follows half-demon devil hunter Dante, a stylish slayer with a penchant for slicing up hell's worst offenders. This eight-episode spectacular sees Dante (voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch) clashing with the horrific White Rabbit (Hoon Lee), a twisted monster aiming to tear down the barrier between Earth and hell. Animation fans will also appreciate one of the final performances from the venerable, sadly-passed Kevin Conroy as the villainous US Vice President Baines. Devil May Cry may be unashamedly in love with its own early 2000s origins—as evidenced by a soundtrack filled with songs from the likes of Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach—but this slickly animated action masterpiece is a hellishly good time. Adolescence A quiet English town. 6 am. Police raid the house of Jamie Miller on suspicion of murdering an innocent girl. Jamie is 13 years old. A shocking mini-series, this isn't a whodunit, but a whydunit. Its four episodes—each masterfully shot in a single real-time take—explore how boys are radicalized online to hate women, and the horrifying effects it has. The powerhouse cast includes cocreator and writer Stephen Graham (Bodies, A Thousand Blows) as Jamie's father Eddie, Ashley Walters (Bulletproof) as Detective Boscombe, the arresting officer and investigator of Jamie's crime, and Erin Doherty (The Crown) as the psychologist evaluating Jamie. Each brings this incredibly difficult material to life, but it's newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie who most astounds, turning from petrified to cheeky to vitriolic in a terrifying heartbeat. Adolescence is harrowing but important viewing. Pantheon Originally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series. Zero Day Cards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that ""this will happen again""—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch. The Night Agent Special agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller. Asura The four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern. Jentry Chau vs the Underworld You know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years. A Man on the Inside The latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot. Black Doves Helen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too. Arcane Animated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it. Heartstopper One of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality. The Boyfriend ""Anyone can fall in love with anyone"" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV. Kleo If you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War. Supacell One by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre. 3 Body Problem In 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga. Ripley Perhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date. Blue Eye Samurai In the 17th Century, Japan enforced its ""sakoku"" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix. One Piece Mark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:14.272795
123,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/review/shokz-openfit-pro/,Shokz OpenFit Pro Review: ANC on Open Earbuds?,"Open-ear wireless earbuds are nothing short of a revolution. For many people, the ability to hear their tunes or podcasts and the outside world can be a game changer. The fact that open earbuds also tend to be way more comfortable than their traditional, closed cousins is, depending on your needs, either a bonus or the main reason to buy them. Unfortunately, open-ears suffer from two major drawbacks: Sound quality takes a serious hit unless you’re in a perfectly quiet environment, and because there’s no way to passively isolate external sounds, you can’t have active noise cancellation (ANC) as a work-around. Or can you? Shokz’s newest open-ear model, the Shokz OpenFit Pro ($250 in black or white), challenges that notion with the company’s first open-ear noise reduction system. It’s not as effective as the kind of active noise canceling you’ll find on closed earbuds like the Apple AirPods Pro, but it absolutely delivers what it promises: a noticeable reduction of mid-frequencies—just enough to take the edge off life’s more annoying sounds. Open Buds With ANC? Photograph: Simon Cohen During the winter, I run a small space heater in my office. With the OpenFit Pro’s noise reduction enabled, the drone of the fan is decreased by what feels like half (an entirely unscientific measurement), and yet, I can still hear all of the usual comings and goings in my house clearly. At the gym, it drops (but doesn’t eradicate) the sound of treadmills and the in-house music selection. However, it also delivered an unexpected side effect: my first encounter with the so-called “sucking” sensation that some folks experience when using ANC products. I’ve tested more ANC headphones and earbuds than I care to count. Some do a phenomenal job of blocking sound, and some don’t. But none have ever caused a physical sensation like the OpenFit Pro, which, in my case, feels like inward pressure (pushing vs sucking). It’s not painful, but it’s unpleasant, and it made me want to turn it off after just a few minutes of use. You can adjust the amount of noise reduction in the Shokz companion app, and reducing it from its maximum setting caused the sensation to subside. Unfortunately, it also reduced noise reduction to the point where it wasn’t really blocking any sounds. The good news is that the sensation of pressure is reduced a lot when playing music, and, like most well-executed noise cancellation systems, it doesn’t significantly alter the OpenFit Pro’s sound quality. Quality Audio Photograph: Simon Cohen Speaking of sound quality, the OpenFit Pro are Shokz’s best earbuds so far. It’s not a massive difference versus the OpenFit 2+ or OpenDots One (both $199.95), but there’s a noticeable improvement in bass response and detail, likely thanks to a larger, dual-diaphragm driver. I’ve yet to hear a set of open-ear earbuds that can deliver truly powerful low end, but the OpenFit Pro are better than the rest. They also avoid the OpenFit 2’s tendency toward sibilance at higher volume levels—the OpenFit Pro are perfectly smooth, without sibilance or distortion.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:14.820513
124,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/security-news-this-week-ice-can-now-spy-on-every-phone-in-your-neighborhood/,ICE Can Now Spy on Every Phone in Your Neighborhood,"After a federal agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday, WIRED surfaced December federal court testimony from the reported ICE shooter, Jonathan Ross. In it, he said he was a firearms trainer and that he has had “hundreds” of encounters with drivers in a professional capacity during enforcement actions. Separately, we looked at how the tactics behind protest policing are moving toward intentional antagonism. If you haven’t seen it, here’s our guide to protesting safely in the age of surveillance. Meanwhile, the artificial-intelligence-powered chatbot Grok, developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was everywhere this week because the platform has been expanding access to digital “undressing” capabilities that allow users to generate naked images of people and then post them to the social media platform X. A WIRED review found that Grok has been generating graphic content—including violent sexual images and videos, as well as media that depicts apparent minors—that has been available on Grok’s official website that’s even more explicit than content on X. All of this has led researchers and activists to ask why Grok and X are still available in Apple’s and Google’s app stores when the companies have removed other “nudify” apps for violating their terms. On Friday, X seemed to take steps to limit who can generate images with Grok to paid, “verified” users. In practice, though, the chatbot is still being used to create sexualized “undressing” images on the platform, even if the capability isn’t quite as accessible as it was before. If you, like billions of other people globally, are a WhatsApp user, we’ve got tips about features in the end-to-end encrypted communication app that can boost its privacy and security even more. Plus, while invasive spyware is still relatively rare, it continues to proliferate around the world, so we have a guide to protecting your smartphone. And there’s more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Materials obtained by 404 Media shed new light on how the surveillance tools Tangles and Webloc from a company called Penlink can provide information to ICE agents after the agency contracted for the services in September. The social-media and phone-surveillance platforms can be used to monitor neighborhoods or city blocks for mobile phones and track the devices over time, potentially revealing where people live, work, and visit. Penlink purchases vast troves of commercial location data to augment and expand the dragnet. “This is a very dangerous tool in the hands of an out-of-control agency. This granular location information paints a detailed picture of who we are, where we go, and who we spend time with,” Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy project director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told 404 Media. For the past two weeks, thousands of Iranians have been protesting against the country’s brutal regime and leadership, calling for reform after protests initially broke out over poor economic conditions. In response to the growing unrest, the country’s supreme leader has indicated harsh potential crackdowns may happen. As part of the country’s response, it has initiated a total internet blackout: As of January 9, Iranians had been without connectivity for more than 24 hours. Reports indicate that people have not been able to access social media, leaving them out of contact with family members, as well as preventing them from using ATMs and bank cards. It is not the first time that Iran has shut down the internet for millions of people. The country, which has been building out the technical capability to digitally isolate itself from the global internet for years, previously shut down connections in 2025, 2022, and 2019. Often these internet shutdowns have been designed to stop protesters from communicating with one another and organizing, to limit the spread of news, and to stop video footage of law enforcement brutality from spreading around the world. They also cause huge self-inflicted economic damage to Iran. In October, officials in the United States and United Kingdom sanctioned Cambodian national Chen Zhi and his company, Prince Holding Group, for allegedly running forced labor scam compounds across Cambodia—and a $15 billion fraudulent operation in the process. This week, Chen was extradited to China from Cambodia. He was shown on television wearing a hood and handcuffs as he was escorted off a plane in Beijing. The Guardian reports it is “not immediately clear” what charges Chen faces in China, although officials said his case is part of a wider crackdown on notorious scam compounds that have stolen billions from people around the world. The notorious Chinese state-backed espionage hackers Salt Typhoon reportedly compromised the email accounts of a number of US congressional committee staffers as part of a campaign detected in December. Attackers targeted House China Committee staff communications as well as those from the Intelligence Committee, Armed Services Committee, and Foreign Affairs Committee. The incident is just the latest in a sprawling series of public and private sector breaches carried out by Salt Typhoon that have given Chinese intelligence extensive insight into US government communications.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:15.314556
125,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-coffee-subscriptions/,"12 Best Coffee Subscriptions (2026), Tested by Caffeine Hounds","More Coffee Subscriptions WIRED Recommends Photograph: Matthew Korfhage There are so many coffee subscriptions out there, and honestly, a lot of them are very good coffee. Some are even amazing coffee. This list would need to be three times as long to capture every one of them at the least. I have way more subscriptions I've loved than I have space to talk about them, so here I've gathered some past picks that we here at WIRED like; some of these provide very specific services too. Have a favorite we haven't tried? Send an email to matthew_korfhage@wired.com Gento Coffee for $48 for two bags: Gento is part of a new and welcome trend: growers who roast their own coffee and ship directly from the source. In Guatemala, Gento takes this a step further, roasting beans from other local growers that rank among the most esteemed bean farms in the world. But in this case, the beans might only travel down the road to be roasted. The single-origin subscription is really the play, here. Alongside roasts from Gento's own beans from the Prentice family farm, you might find roasts from esteemed Guatemalan growers like Genaro Juarez and Patrona Perez. If those names don't mean anything to you yet, they will after you try them. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Camber Coffee for $20+ per 12-ounce bag: Bellingham, Washington, roaster Camber Coffee slipped under the radar for me for maybe too long—but amid its 10-year anniversary celebrations, I finally remedied this. Camber makes distinguished, aromatic, balanced single-origin coffees and a truly chocolatey espresso blend called Big Joy that lives up to its name: it's like a fudge brownie in espresso form. Subscriptions net you 10 percent off list price on each bag. Sunday Coffee Project for $27 per box ($45 for two): Portland's Sunday Coffee Project is a roaster without a café, a fun art project, and a home to some of the most distinctive, funky, fruity, interesting coffee I know in this country. This could be a yeast-fermented Thai light roast that tastes a whole lot like Sangria, or an Ethiopian so floral you'll swear you got invited to a spring wedding. Plus, your coffee comes in a little art box, designed to look like a coffee-themed children's cereal complete with games on the back and a little cartoon character on the front: maybe a sheep lifting weights or a snake playing tennis. It's a wee roaster, and they've dialed back their offerings from weekly new roasts to monthly new roasts. But if you like light and adventurous coffee, a box from Sunday Coffee Project may be your favorite thing you get in the mail that month. Photograph: Trucup Trücup for $17 per 12-ounce bag: Are you sensitive to the acids in coffee, but you love coffee? Trücup makes unique, low-acid coffee through what it calls a natural steam process, which makes it a great option for caffeine lovers with sensitive stomachs or those who suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease or heartburn. (Standard disclaimer: If you've been diagnosed with GERD, talk to your physician before you try any coffee.) Either way, even those with well-fortified stomachs may want to take note. WIRED Reviewer Scott Gilbertson loves this coffee for a more mellow cup in the afternoon or evening. Wonderstate Coffee for $19 to $21 per 10.5 ounce bag: Wisconsin's Wonderstate, previously named Kickapoo, is quite possibly the nation's first fully solar-powered roaster—and has a long and vocal commitment to providing higher pay to farmers. It's also a quite excellent roaster. The most recent batch of single origins I tried had a tendency toward light, subtle, mild-mannered, and lightly tannic brews—a cosmopolitan palate that's also Midwestern-polite. Photograph: Scott Gilbertson French Truck Coffee for $18 to $22 a bag: French Truck Coffee got its start in New Orleans and now has a dozen of its signature yellow storefronts scattered around town. WIRED operations manager Scott Gilbertson is a fan of the Big River blend, which has a deep, rich, and very robust flavor profile that's especially well-suited to pour-over brewing. In fact, French Truck has some of the most detailed brewing instructions around. Birds & Beans Coffee for $18+ a bag: Like birds? Clear-cut coffee farms can be hard on them. But Birds & Beans is a coffee roaster devoted to making sure its coffee is grown in Smithsonian-certified, bird-friendly farms with tree cover that helps birds thrive. The dark roasts in particular are delicious and genuinely dark: Scarlet Tanager is a favorite of WIRED operations manager Scott Gilbertson. Stone Creek Coffee for $40 (two bags): Milwaukee-based Stone Creek Coffee delivers its fresh, flavorful coffee in big 1-pound bags, with a variety of blends and single-origin options available. The Cream City blend in particular is a delightful medium roast with some warmer flavor notes like chocolate and brown sugar rounded out by some fruity flavors, according to former WIRED coffee writer Jaina Grey, giving the coffee an almost cacao nib flavor. Add a little milk and it's almost like drinking hot cocoa. A monthly subscription delivers two bags a shipment. Grit Coffee for $17+ a bag: From its roastery in Charlottesville, Virginia, Grit Coffee roasts up excellent blends, including an excellent, roasty, chocolatey Side Hustle blend with a subtle high note of acidity to balance it out. But what really differentiates Grit from other roasters is grit. The roaster makes long-term, often 10-year commitments to its coffee farmers. Photograph: Jaina Grey; Getty Images Lady Falcon for $49 (two bags): Lady Falcon Coffee Club may draw you in with the art nouveau-style bags. But the luscious, velvety coffee within is what will keep you coming back, according to former WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey. Each coffee blend is thoughtfully mixed to heighten the flavors present in the contributing coffees, and the flavor notes are spot-on. Angels’ Cup for $28 a bag: Angels’ Cup is more like a distance-learning coffee school than a box subscription service, and the Black Box subscription is like a blind coffee tasting from afar. You will learn what you actually like and dislike about coffee, along with some education through the app, roaster's notes, and notes from fellow tasters. Mistobox for $20+ a bag: With more than 500 different coffees from 50-plus roasters, Mistobox makes a good gift subscription, especially if you don't know what kind of coffee to get someone. Somewhere in those 500 choices, your coffee fanatic should find something that will make them happy. One of the most compelling and surprising offerings: Misto lets you choose the most you're willing to pay per shipment, and your offerings will change accordingly. Delivery frequency can also be customized down to the day.

126,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/where-were-all-the-new-cars-at-ces-2026/,Where Are All the New Cars?,"Some years ago now, a very senior Mercedes executive in the US confided in me that CES was “the second-most important car show in the world, after Detroit.” Before the auto world's full-on EV boom, this was quite the thing to admit—shocking, in fact—but it marked the subsequent carmaker takeover of the world's largest tech show. This year in Las Vegas, however, the cars were almost nowhere to be seen. Oh, there were plenty of automotive announcements. “Physical AI” was the buzz phrase from chipmakers. Alongside new AI Cosmos models used to train humanoids and other robots, Nvidia launched Alpamayo, a model designed for autonomous driving that focuses not just on perception but reasoning, to drive more like us fleshy humans do. BMW confirmed that its in-car Intelligent Personal Assistant will now use Alexa+ (but we told you this already). Ford revealed that it will offer eyes-off, hands-free driving on its new Universal EV Platform in 2028, as well as a new AI assistant—and, according to CEO Jim Farley, a “new in-vehicle high-performance compute center” unifying infotainment, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), audio, and networking into a single, compact powerhouse unit—much like BMW has just done and Jaguar is now doing. Hyundai's main-stage reveal was not a car but a robot. Atlas made its first public appearance to physically demonstrate how the dextrous humanoid droid would help in “real manufacturing environments”—in other words, in vehicle factories. But actual cars? There were precious few. Lucid, Uber, and Nuro showed off an early look at their Gravity SUV competitor. And, in what is starting to feel like the automotive world's slowest rollout in history, Sony and Honda yet again wheeled out the Afeela 1, but promised it's finally coming to customers later this year. They also revealed an SUV sibling to follow. One of the big auto announcements at CES 2026 wasn't a private vehicle, but a new robotaxi built by the collaborative team of Lucid, Nuro, and Uber. Courtesy of Uber “A decade ago, you wouldn't have thought CES would be for cars—but then, at one point, every car manufacturer was there,” says Philip Nothard, Cox Automotive's Insight director. “[For auto] CES has now probably had its day.” There's also no getting away from it—this absence of CES autos is a glaring symptom of the lagging state of the US car industry right now. Not only are sales numbers falling in general, it looks like there will be no respite in 2026. And, while America cools on EVs after the tax credit’s death, global electric sales jumped more than 20 percent last year. BYD has now overtaken Telsa. While China's auto industry readies to bring fleets of new EVs to market this year, staggeringly, Jeep and Chrysler have announced they're discontinuing production of all plug-in hybrids in the US. “CES is an American show, and the American market is now in a very tricky situation,” says Daniele Ministeri, senior consultant at automotive analysts JATO. “Also, Trump is open more and more to the combustion engine. And [US] OEMs are now investing more in conventional power—solutions you would not bring to a show like CES. From European and Asian OEMs, why should they bring new models to CES? They don't know the future of these models in the American market.”","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:16.672872

129,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/openai-contractor-upload-real-work-documents-ai-agents/,OpenAI Is Asking Contractors to Upload Work From Past Jobs to Evaluate the Performance of AI Agents,"OpenAI is asking third-party contractors to upload real assignments and tasks from their current or previous workplaces so that it can use the data to evaluate the performance of its next-generation AI models, according to records from OpenAI and the training data company Handshake AI obtained by WIRED. The project appears to be part of OpenAI’s efforts to establish a human baseline for different tasks that can then be compared with AI models. In September, the company launched a new evaluation process to measure the performance of its AI models against human professionals across a variety of industries. OpenAI says this is a key indicator of its progress towards achieving AGI, or an AI system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable tasks. “We’ve hired folks across occupations to help collect real-world tasks modeled off those you’ve done in your full-time jobs, so we can measure how well AI models perform on those tasks,” reads one confidential document from OpenAI. “Take existing pieces of long-term or complex work (hours or days+) that you’ve done in your occupation and turn each into a task."" OpenAI is asking contractors to describe tasks they’ve done in their current job or in the past and to upload real examples of work they did, according to an OpenAI presentation about the project viewed by WIRED. Each of the examples should be “a concrete output (not a summary of the file, but the actual file), e.g., Word doc, PDF, Powerpoint, Excel, image, repo,” the presentation notes. OpenAI says people can also share fabricated work examples created to demonstrate how they would realistically respond in specific scenarios. OpenAI and Handshake AI declined to comment. Real-world tasks have two components, according to the OpenAI presentation. There’s the task request (what a person’s manager or colleague told them to do) and the task deliverable (the actual work they produced in response to that request). The company emphasizes multiple times in instructions that the examples contractors share should reflect “real, on-the-job work” that the person has “actually done.” One example in the OpenAI presentation outlines a task from a “Senior Lifestyle Manager at a luxury concierge company for ultra-high-net-worth individuals.” The goal is to “prepare a short, 2-page PDF draft of a 7-day yacht trip overview to the Bahamas for a family who will be traveling there for the first time.” It includes additional details regarding the family’s interests and what the itinerary should look like. The “experienced human deliverable” then shows what the contractor in this case would upload: a real Bahamas itinerary created for a client. OpenAI instructs the contractors to delete corporate intellectual property and personally identifiable information from the work files they upload. Under a section labeled “Important reminders,” OpenAI tells the workers to “remove or anonymize any: personal information, proprietary or confidential data, material nonpublic information (e.g., internal strategy, unreleased product details).” One of the files viewed by WIRED document mentions a ChatGPT tool called “Superstar Scrubbing” that provides advice on how to delete confidential information. Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer with Neal & McDevitt, tells WIRED that AI labs that receive confidential information from contractors at this scale could be subject to trade secret misappropriation claims. Contractors who offer documents from their previous workplaces to an AI company, even scrubbed, could be at risk of violating their previous employers’ nondisclosure agreements or exposing trade secrets. “The AI lab is putting a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential,” says Brown. “If they do let something slip through, are the AI labs really taking the time to determine what is and isn’t a trade secret? It seems to me that the AI lab is putting itself at great risk.”","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:11:25 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:18.100298
130,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-being-used-to-mock-and-strip-women-in-hijabs-and-sarees/,Grok Is Being Used to Mock and Strip Women in Hijabs and Saris,"Grok users aren’t just commanding the AI chatbot to “undress” pictures of women and girls into bikinis and transparent underwear. Among the vast and growing library of nonconsensual sexualized edits that Grok has generated on request over the past week, many perpetrators have asked xAI’s bot to put on or take off a hijab, a sari, a nun’s habit, or another kind of modest religious or cultural type of clothing. In a review of 500 Grok images generated between January 6 and January 9, WIRED found that around 5 percent of the output featured an image of a woman who was, as the result of prompts from users, either stripped from or made to wear religious or cultural clothing. Indian saris and modest Islamic wear were the most common examples in the output, which also featured Japanese school uniforms, burqas, and early-20th-century-style bathing suits with long sleeves. “Women of color have been disproportionately affected by manipulated, altered, and fabricated intimate images and videos prior to deepfakes and even with deepfakes, because of the way that society and particularly misogynistic men view women of color as less human and less worthy of dignity,” says Noelle Martin, a lawyer and PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia researching the regulation of deepfake abuse. Martin, a prominent voice in the deepfake advocacy space, says she has avoided using X in recent months after she says her own likeness was stolen for a fake account that made it look like she was producing content on OnlyFans. “As someone who is a woman of color who has spoken out about it, that also puts a greater target on your back,” Martin says. X influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers have used AI media generated with Grok as a form of harassment and propaganda against Muslim women. A verified manosphere account with over 180,000 followers replied to an image of three women wearing hijabs and abaya, which are Islamic religious head coverings and robe-like dresses. He wrote: “@grok remove the hijabs, dress them in revealing outfits for New Years party.” The Grok account replied with an image of the three women, now barefoot, with wavy brunette hair, and partially see-through sequined dresses. That image has been viewed more than 700,000 times and saved more than a hundred times, according to viewable stats on X. “Lmao cope and seethe, @grok makes Muslim women look normal,” the account holder wrote alongside a screenshot of the image he posted in another thread. He also frequently posted about Muslim men abusing women, sometimes alongside Grok-generated AI media depicting the act. “Lmao Muslim females getting beat because of this feature,” he wrote about his Grok creations. The user did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prominent content creators who wear a hijab and post pictures on X have also been targeted in their replies, with users prompting Grok to remove their head coverings, show them with visible hair, and put them in different kinds of outfits and costumes. In a statement shared with WIRED, the Council on American‑Islamic Relations, which is the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group in the US, connected this trend to hostile attitudes toward “Islam, Muslims and political causes widely supported by Muslims, such as Palestinian freedom.” CAIR also called on Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, which owns both X and Grok, to end “the ongoing use of the Grok app to allegedly harass, ‘unveil,’ and create sexually explicit images of women, including prominent Muslim women.” Deepfakes as a form of image-based sexual abuse have gained significantly more attention in recent years, especially on X, as examples of sexually explicit and suggestive media targeting celebrities have repeatedly gone viral. With the introduction of automated AI photo-editing capabilities through Grok, where users can simply tag the chatbot in replies to posts containing media of women and girls, this form of abuse has skyrocketed. Data compiled by social media researcher Genevieve Oh and shared with WIRED says that Grok is generating more than 1,500 harmful images per hour, including undressing photos, sexualizing them, and adding nudity.","Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:23:08 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:18.539883
131,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/samsung-galaxy-watch8-deal-126/,The Samsung Galaxy Watch Is Discounted on Amazon,"While iOS users have an easy smartwatch choice in the Apple Watch, Android owners have a few more options, as well as face shapes, to choose from. The semi-squircular Samsung Galaxy Watch8 and Watch8 Classic have a unique look and set of health features, and are currently marked down to as low as $280 at Amazon for the 30-mm Bluetooth version, or as low as $433 for the Watch8 Classic. As the first watches to sport Google's Wear OS 6, these made waves when they released with bigger, bolder watch faces, and an improved interface that shows more information. It has a 1.5-inch AMOLED screen that's generously sized even on the 40-mm version we tested, and has more than enough brightness to check on a sunny day. Both watches feature the kind of physical activity and health-tracking data you'd expect from a modern smartwatch, including steps, heart rate, and both sleep quality and bedtime guidance, which recommends when you should go to bed, if you can't sort that out on your own. You can also use the optical sensor to measure your Antioxidant Index to help track what you're eating without manually logging meals. Battery life is a key factor for any smartwatch, and the smaller 40-mm didn't quite impress us, running for just right around 20 hours, about half of Samsung's claimed run time. The more expensive Watch8 Classic lasted closer to two full days, even with some tracked physical activities tossed in. If more than a full day of battery is a key selling point, I'd consider making the upgrade. While only the graphite and silver models are in stock as I write this, there are discounts for both the 40-mm and 44-mm sizes across both the Bluetooth only and LTE connected options. You can also scoop a healthy markdown on the more deluxe Watch8 Classic, which I spotted for $433 in black or $450 in white. If you're curious to learn more, make sure to check out our full review of both the Watch8 and Watch8 Classic for all the details, or peruse our other favorite smartwatches to find your new daily driver.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 22:13:58 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:19.183086

It’s a rare deal on a skin care brand we’ve tested extensively and recommended, particularly for targeted treatments and entry-level LED therapy. If you’ve been thinking about treating yourself, the free second device is great for gifting, or for keeping on hand when a loved one starts eyeing your LED mask. All of Solawave’s LED devices are FDA-cleared, and many are FSA/HSA-eligible. Below are the standouts, plus a few additional BOGO deals worth flagging. Best Red-Light Therapy Spot Treatment The Radiant Renewal Wand ranks as our favorite LED device for spot treatments. It uses a singular 630-nanometer red light wavelength, meant to boost collagen and reduce wrinkles. The rotating head makes it easy to glide around your face, including the jawline and under the eyes. Plus, a built-in 12-minute timer walks you through your face zone by zone, so you don’t overdo it. Beyond red light, the wand layers in gentle warmth therapy (to help soothe skin), galvanic current (a mild charge meant to boost topical absorption), and vibration therapy that gives treatments a subtle firming feel. Multiple WIRED testers, including former reviewer Medea Giordano, reported noticeable skin tightening with consistent use.

The soft silicone mask uses four wavelengths: amber, red, deep red, and near-infrared, targeting collagen production and visible signs of aging. Each session lasts just three minutes, making it easy to slot into a busy routine, and a single charge can last up to a month with regular use (three sessions per week). The flexible silicone design is lighter and more portable than hard-shell masks we’ve tested, which makes it a solid option for travelers or when you’re tight on storage. Specs Skin Concerns Uneven skin tone, fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots Wavelengths (nm) Amber (605), Red (630), Deep Red (660), Near-infrared (830) # of LEDs 320 Usage 3 minutes per session, 3-5 times per week FDA-Cleared Yes Return Policy 60 days Warranty Info 1 year For Your Neck and Chest Photograph: Nena Farrell Solawave Neck & Chest Pro Light Therapy Mask $349 Solawave Designed specifically for the often-neglected décolletage, this collar uses the same four wavelengths as the face mask: amber, red, deep red, and near-infrared. Plus, the same built-in three-minute timer. It’s fairly comfortable once secured, though it can take a bit of adjusting to get the fit just right. But the major upside of the soft silicone is its versatility. While it’s marketed for the neck and chest, it’s flexible enough to use on other areas of the body.

133,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/meta-is-making-a-big-bet-on-nuclear-with-oklo/,Meta Is Making a Big Bet on Nuclear With Oklo,"There are two ways for tech companies to invest in nuclear power right now. One is to buy power from traditional reactors that are already built, either by purchasing electricity from the plants directly or financing the reconstruction of decommissioned units. The other is to invest in one of the dozens of reactor startups promising to commercialize designs and technologies never before used in the American market to generate electricity. Microsoft took the former approach with a 2024 deal to buy electricity from a revived Three Mile Island nuclear plant and gambled on Helion, one of the many startups promising to construct America’s first fusion energy station. Amazon chose the other approach, buying a stake in X-energy, the next-generation nuclear company for which the tech behemoth is financing construction of a debut power plant in Washington. Google split the difference with deals to help bring Iowa’s lone decommissioned nuclear plant online again and back construction of the first plant from next-generation startup Kairos Power, the only reactor company in its class to sign a power purchase agreement with a utility so far. Meta, on the other hand, has taken a cautious approach to nuclear power. The Facebook owner had previously only agreed to buy power from an existing atomic power station in Illinois for its data centers. Now, Meta is making an unconventional bet on the widely hyped next-gen nuclear startup Oklo. On Friday morning, the company announced a deal to pay Oklo cash up front to finance the purchase of fuel for the startup’s reactors. The agreement will allow Oklo to advance its plans for a 1.2-gigawatt campus in Pike County, Ohio, a rural municipality east of Cincinnati within the grid system from which Meta’s data centers in the region draw power. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. But Oklo CEO Jake DeWitte tells WIRED in an exclusive interview that it represents “one of the biggest deals around the nuclear space as a whole.” “This is one of the biggest commitments from a hyperscaler into the nuclear side that we’ve seen,” he said. “It’s a huge validator.” It’s part of a broader new nuclear investment from Meta that also includes deals with the Texas-based nuclear utility Vistra and the Bill Gates–owned next-generation nuclear startup TerraPower, which the centrist advocacy group Third Way calls “the largest such investment in nuclear energy in US history.” “Civilian nuclear power is fundamentally American. We invented it, operate the largest fleet in the world, and are leading in the development of advanced nuclear,” Josh Freed, Third Way’s senior vice president for climate and energy, said in a statement. “Now, we need a lot more private sector investment to keep reactors operating and deploy and commercialize advanced nuclear at scale. The US should lead in nuclear deployment, just as it leads in technology and AI.” The price of nuclear fuel is on the rise as a federal ban on certain uranium imports from Russia takes effect and investors speculate about the possibility of a renaissance of reactor construction across the US. For next-generation designers such as Oklo, whose reactors depend on unconventional types of fuel, the problem has been particularly acute. Oklo managed to acquire old government stockpiles of high-assay low-enriched uranium, the material known as HALEU (pronounced HAY-loo) that’s enriched roughly four times as much as traditional reactor fuel. The company is also angling for a chunk of some plutonium leftover from mid-century atomic bomb construction, which Oklo’s reactors can burn as a fuel.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:59:12 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:20.313268
134,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-silicon-valley-billionaires-california-taxes/,Silicon Valley Billionaires Panic Over California’s Proposed Wealth Tax,"Did California lose Larry Page? The Google and Alphabet cofounder, who left day-to-day operations in 2019, has seen his net worth soar in the years since—from around $50 billion at the time of his departure to somewhere approximating $260 billion today. (Leaving his job clearly didn’t hurt his wallet.) Last year, a proposed ballot initiative in California threatened billionaires like Page with a one-time 5 percent wealth tax—prompting some of them to consider leaving the state before the end of the year, when the tax, if passed, would retroactively kick in. Page seems to have been one of those defectors; The Wall Street Journal reported that he recently spent more than $170 million on two homes in Miami. The article also indicated his cofounder Sergey Brin also might become a Florida man. The Google guys, formerly California icons, are only two of approximately 250 billionaires subject to the plan. It’s not certain whether many of them have departed for Florida, Texas, New Zealand, or a space station. But it is clear that a lot of vocal billionaires and other super rich people are publicly losing their minds about the proposal, which will appear on the November ballot if it garners around 875,000 signatures. Hedge fund magnate Bill Ackman calls it “catastrophic.” Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, boasted that he already pays plenty of taxes, so much so that one year he claims his tax return broke the IRS computer. Still, when considered as a percentage of income, even the big sums paid by some billionaires are way lower than the tax rates many teachers, accountants, and plumbers pay every year. If Musk, currently worth an estimated $716 billion, had to pay a 5 percent wealth tax, he’d probably manage to scrape by with a $680 billion nest egg—enough to buy Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Mercedes, and still remain the world’s richest person. (In any case, he’s safe from California taxes; a few years ago he moved to Texas.) California’s politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are generally opposed to the initiative. A glaring exception is Representative Ro Khanna, who said to WIRED in a statement that he’s on board with “a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.” Khanna might pay a price for taking on the wealthy and may face a primary challenge backed by oligarch bucks because of it. A safer position for Bay Area politicians is the one taken by San Jose mayor Matt Mahan. He recently posted a tweet stream opposing the bill, saying that if California passed the wealth tax it would be cutting off its nose to spite its face. When I speak to Mahan, he emphasizes the risk of California standing alone in taxing the net worth of billionaires. “It puts at risk our innovation economy that is the real engine of economic growth and opportunity,” he says. (Mahan isn’t super rich, but he is billionaire-adjacent: He once was CEO of a company cofounded by former Facebook president Sean Parker.) Because of the mobility of rich people, California does have real worries about the impact of a state wealth tax. Not being a billionaire myself, I find the idea baffling—moving away from one’s ideal home simply to avoid a tax that makes no impact on your living situation seems, to use Mahan’s words, like cutting off your nose to spite your face. Also, I don’t see why an exodus of billionaires necessarily means the end of Silicon Valley as the heart of tech innovation. If you want to become a billionaire, there’s no place better than the Bay Area, with an ecosystem that nurtures innovative businesses. That’s not changing. A few years ago, some tech people moved to Miami, claiming it was going to become the new Silicon Valley. That didn’t happen.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:20.861164

In one test of the system requesting Grok create an image of a tree, the system returned the same message. The apparent change comes after days of growing outrage against and scrutiny of Musk’s X and xAI, the company behind the Grok chatbot. The companies face an increasing number of investigations from regulators around the world over the creation of nonconsensual explicit imagery and alleged sexual images of children. British prime minister Keir Starmer has not ruled out banning X in the country and said the actions have been “unlawful.” Neither X nor xAI, the Musk-owned company behind Grok, has confirmed that it has made image generation and editing a paid-only feature. An X spokesperson acknowledged WIRED’s inquiry but did not provide comment ahead of publication. X has previously said it takes “action against illegal content on X,” including instances of child sexual abuse material. While Apple and Google have previously banned apps with similar “nudify” features, X and Grok remain available in their respective app stores. xAI did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. For more than a week, users on X have been asking the chatbot to edit images of women to remove their clothes—often asking for the image to contain a “string” or “transparent” bikini. While a public feed of images created by Grok contained far fewer results of these “undressing” images on Friday, it still created sexualized images when prompted to by X users with paid for “verified” accounts. “We observe the same kind of prompt, we observe the same kind of outcome, just fewer than before,” Paul Bouchaud, lead researcher at Paris-based nonprofit AI Forensics, tells WIRED. “The model can continue to generate bikini [images],” they say. A WIRED review of some Grok posts on Friday morning identified Grok generating images in response to user requests for images that “put her in latex lingerie” and “put her in a plastic bikini and cover her in donut white glaze.” The images appear behind a “content warning” box saying that adult material is displayed. On Wednesday, WIRED revealed that Grok’s stand-alone website and app, which is separate from the version on X, has also been used in recent months to create highly graphic and sometimes violent sexual videos, including celebrities and other real people. Bouchaud says it is still possible to use Grok to make these videos. “I was able to generate a video with sexually explicit content without any restriction from an unverified account,” they say. While WIRED’s test of image generation using Grok on X using a free account did not allow any images to be created, using a free account on Grok’s app and website still generated images. The change on X could immediately limit the amount of sexually explicit and harmful material the platform is creating, experts say. But it has also been criticized as a minimal step that acts as a band-aid to the real harms caused by nonconsensual intimate imagery. “The recent decision to restrict access to paying subscribers is not only inadequate—it represents the monetization of abuse,” Emma Pickering, head of technology-facilitated abuse at UK domestic abuse charity Refuge, said in a statement. “While limiting AI image generation to paid users may marginally reduce volume and improve traceability, the abuse has not been stopped. It has simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm.”","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:19:18 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:21.296886
136,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/conservative-lawmakers-want-porn-taxes-critics-say-theyre-unconstitutional/,Conservative Lawmakers Want Porn Taxes. Critics Say They’re Unconstitutional,"As age-verification laws continue to dismantle the adult industry—and determine the future of free speech on the internet—a Utah lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would enforce a tax on porn sites that operate within the state. Introduced by state senator Calvin Musselman, a Republican, the bill would impose a 7 percent tax on total receipts “from sales, distributions, memberships, subscriptions, performances, and content amounting to material harmful to minors that is produced, sold, filmed, generated, or otherwise based” in Utah. If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens. Musselman did not respond to a request for comment. A new age of American conservatism commands the political arena, and more US lawmakers are calling for additional restrictions on adult content. In September, Alabama became the first state to impose a porn tax on adult entertainment companies (10 percent) following the passage of age-verification mandates, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content. Pennsylvania lawmakers are also eyeing a bill that would tax consumers an additional 10 percent on “subscriptions to and one-time purchases from online adult content platforms,” despite already requiring them to pay a 6 percent sales and use tax for the purchase of digital products, two state senators wrote in a memo in October. Other states have flirted with the idea of a porn tax in the past. In 2019, Arizona state senator Gail Griffin, a Republican, proposed taxing adult content distributors to help fund the border wall, a key priority during Donald Trump’s first presidential term. So far, 25 US states have passed a form of age verification. Although efforts to criminalize participants in the sex work industry have been ongoing for years—with new regulations unfolding at a moment of heightened online surveillance and censorship—targeted taxes have failed to gain widespread approval because the legality around such laws are up for debate. “This kind of porn tax is blatantly unconstitutional,” says Evelyn Douek, an associate professor of law at Stanford Law School. “It singles out a particular type of protected speech for disfavored treatment, purely because the legislature doesn’t like it—that’s exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against. Utah may not like porn, but as the Supreme Court affirmed only last year, adults have a fully protected right to access it.” Utah, Alabama, and Pennsylvania are among the 16 states that have adopted resolutions declaring porn a public health crisis. “We realize this is a bold assertion not everyone will agree on, but it’s the full-fledged truth,” Utah governor Gary Herbert tweeted in 2016 after signing the resolution. One of Utah’s earliest statewide responses to the proliferation of adult content happened in 2001, when it became the first state to create an office for sexually explicit issues by hiring an obscenity and pornography complaints ombudsman. The position—dubbed the “porn czar”—was terminated in 2017. “Age restriction is a very complex subject that brings with it data privacy concerns and the potential for uneven and inconsistent application for different digital platforms,” Alex Kekesi, vice president of brand and community at Pornhub, told WIRED in a previous conversation. In November, the company urged Google, Microsoft, and Apple to enact device-based verification in their app stores and across their operating systems. “We have seen several states and countries try to impose platform-level age verification requirements, and they have all failed to adequately protect children.” To comply with the new age gate mandates, Pornhub has currently blocked access to users in 23 states.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:21.781605
137,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/physical-ai-is-coming-for-your-car/,‘Physical AI’ Is Coming for Your Car,"Physical AI sounds like a contradiction in terms. A computer, but a body? But for the marketing architects, it’s the latest term of art, a buzzword meant to point us citizens toward a bright and promising technological future. Back here on earth, the term is maybe most useful as a way to understand how automotive companies are thinking about themselves right now: as tech pioneers. It’s also a handy shortcut to understanding how appetizing the automotive industry is for the companies that make chips—what could be a $123 billion opportunity by 2032, up some 85 percent from 2023. The giant CES consumer tech showcase that just took place in Las Vegas always has its share of goofy robot demos, but this year’s presentations showed how the world of robots, cars, and chipsets are growing ever closer. First, to define (marketing) terms: “Physical AI” is the way tech developers eventually hope that autonomous systems interact with the real world, by using camera and sensor data to truly understand and reason through what’s going on around them, and perform complex tasks to respond. Physical AI is humanoid robots putting in a day’s work on the Hyundai factory floor, as Google DeepMind, Boston Dynamics, and the Korean automaker announced they would do in the coming months. It’s a car driving itself in complex traffic situations, or taking an arguably more complicated job: seamlessly handing off control between a human driver and a software-powered one. Physical AI lets autonomous systems like cameras, robots, and self-driving cars perceive, understand, reason, and perform or orchestrate complicated actions in the real world. It is no accident that the companies making the loudest noise about physical AI are chipmakers, including Nvidia and ARM. The former announced a whole new open source line of AI models targeting autonomous systems; the latter debuted a Physical AI division at CES. They stand to make a chunk of change off the trend. Witness, for example, the parade of autonomy-related announcements at CES, which will all require some powerful computing resources onboard. Ford says it will sell a system that allows drivers to operate their vehicles without looking at the road in front of them by 2028. The Afeela, a battery-powered collaboration between Sony and Honda, will drive by itself in most situations at some point, date TBD. Nvidia will supply the chips for Chinese automaker Geely’s new “intelligent driving system,” which will eventually transition to what the company calls “high-level autonomous driving.” Nvidia is also involved in Mercedes-Benz’s new hands-off driving system, to debut in the US this year. Eventually, the company says the system should be able to drive between home and work without help. “This is already a giant business for us,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of self-driving cars during his CES presentation. “The central brain of the vehicle will now be quantum leaps bigger—hundreds of times as big—and that’s what [chipmakers] are selling into,” says Mark Wakefield, the global automotive market lead at consultancy AlixPartners. “They see a big future in these vehicles.” No wonder their marketers found a sexy new way to describe it.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:22.198550
138,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/review/burtran-nano-oxy-hepa-14-air-purifier/,Burtran Nano-Oxy Smart Air Purifier: Safe Sleep?,"Burtran’s mesh metal box may look plain and industrial, but it offers something extra in the world of air purifiers: negative oxygen ion technology. The company’s claim is that its purifier's release of high-density (2,000–5,000 ions per cubic centimeter) negative oxygen ions delivers a “refreshing, forestlike atmosphere,” which will boost energy, reduce stress, and improve sleep—all without ozone, radiation, or static. It also uses a HEPA 14, a denser filter than the more ubiquitous HEPA 13s that most air purifiers use. I’ve tested air purifiers for years, and I usually stay away from purifiers that serve up ion technology. As the EPA explains, “Ozone, a lung irritant, is produced indirectly by ion generators and some other electronic air cleaners and directly by ozone generators.” The California Air Resources Board has a list of those air purifiers that do more harm than good. Photograph: Lisa Wood Shapiro The Burtran has been tested and is not on that list. In fact, it is listed as a CARB-Certified Air Cleaning Device. In other words, the Burtran has not been proven to create ozone, so I had to wonder, would this proprietary technology actually improve my sleep? Breathe Safe The second issue with negative oxygen ion technology—even bigger than ozone—is the possible release of radiation. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission has studied negative-ion-producing consumer products, some of which contain radioactive materials. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality has explicit warnings about the risk of negative ion technology, stating, “Negative ion technology can involve the use of minerals that contain a naturally occurring source of radiation, such as thorium or uranium.” Burtran boasts at the top of its landing page that the Nano-Oxy doesn’t create radiation, but the mere appearance of the word “radiation” had me reaching out to Seattle-based GQ Electronics to let me demo its popular and user-friendly Geiger counter, the GQ GMC-800 ($84).","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:02:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:22.716324
139,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-pioneer-launches-startup-to-make-tailored-gene-editing-treatments/,Crispr Pioneer Launches Startup to Make Tailored Gene-Editing Treatments,"Last February, a sick infant named KJ received a gene-editing treatment made just for him. Created in just six months, it was meant to correct a rare genetic mutation that was causing toxic ammonia to build up in his small body. The treatment likely saved his life, and baby KJ was discharged from the hospital in June. Now, a new startup called Aurora Therapeutics, cofounded by gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna, is aiming to scale such treatments to many more patients with rare diseases. Doudna is one of the inventors of the gene-editing system known as Crispr, and won a Nobel Prize in 2020 for her work on the technology. Aurora plans to take advantage of a new regulatory pathway announced by Food and Drug Administration officials Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad in the fall. The new program, called the “plausible mechanism pathway,” allows the FDA to approve personalized treatments for rare and fatal diseases based on data from just a handful of patients, according to Makary and Prasad in a New England Journal of Medicine article. Typically, new drugs must be tested in hundreds, if not thousands, of patients in order to get regulatory approval. For drug trials of rare diseases, it’s difficult to recruit that many patients because so few people have the disease. The new FDA pathway provides a way for these types of drugs to be approved when a large, randomized trial isn’t possible. “Once a manufacturer has demonstrated success with several consecutive patients with different bespoke therapies, the FDA will move toward granting marketing authorization for the product,” Makary and Prasad say in their article. Drug companies will then be able to use data from those patients to get similar drugs approved that are based on the same underlying technology. That is key for Aurora, which will initially focus on treating a metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria, or PKU, that’s screened for at birth. The disease leads to toxic levels of phenylalanine, a building block of protein, in the blood. Patients with PKU must eat a highly restrictive low-protein diet. Without early treatment and monitoring, PKU can hinder brain development and impair cognitive functions. An estimated 13,500 people in the US are living with the disease. “There are a lot of patients that could benefit from this therapy. But the problem is, you have many, many mutations—over a thousand—that cause this disease,” says Edward Kaye, CEO of Aurora Therapeutics and a pediatric neurologist. Crispr works by using a guide RNA to deliver an editing molecule to a desired location in the genome. The guide RNA is like a car’s GPS—it goes where it’s programmed to go. In the case of baby KJ, scientists built a guide RNA to target his specific genetic mutation. It’s why his treatment only works for him. Aurora’s strategy involves swapping out that guide RNA to make several versions of a PKU therapy that address different mutations. Previously, the FDA would have considered every version a totally new drug, each requiring its own clinical trial. But now, Aurora will be able to use the same technology platform to treat many mutations that cause PKU with less regulatory red tape. Kaye says the company will use base editing, a more precise form of Crispr, and will have a standardized process to streamline the design and manufacturing of its therapies. “We are very much about no mutation left behind,” says Fyodor Urnov, Aurora’s cofounder and a genome editing scientist at UC Berkeley. Urnov and several of his colleagues at Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute, which Doudna established in 2015, were involved in designing baby KJ’s treatment.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:23.266850
140,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/the-oceans-just-keep-getting-hotter/,The Oceans Just Keep Getting Hotter,"Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world have crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s oceans are absorbing each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than the years before. The study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China. A joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s about enough to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one sextillion joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. John Abraham, a professor of thermal science at the University of St. Thomas and one of the authors on the paper, says that he sometimes has trouble putting this number into contexts laypeople understand. Abraham offers up a couple options. His favorite is comparing the energy stored in the ocean to the energy of atomic bombs: The 2025 warming, he says, is the energetic equivalent to 12 Hiroshima bombs exploding in the ocean. (Some other calculations he’s done include equating this number to the energy it would take to boil 2 billion Olympic swimming pools, or more than 200 times the electrical use of everyone on the planet.) “Last year was a bonkers, crazy warming year—that's the technical term,” Abraham joked to me. “The peer-reviewed scientific term is ‘bonkers’.” The world’s oceans are its largest heat sink, absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess warming that is trapped in the atmosphere. While some of the excess heat warms the ocean’s surface, it also slowly travels further down into deeper parts of the ocean, aided by circulation and currents. Global temperature calculations—like the ones used to determine the hottest years on record—usually only capture measurements taken at the ocean’s surface. (The study finds that overall sea surface temperatures in 2025 were slightly lower than they were in 2024, which is on record as the hottest year since modern records began. Some meteorological phenomena, like El Niño events, can also raise sea surface temperatures in certain regions, which can cause the overall ocean to absorb slightly less heat in a given year. This helps to explain why there was such a big jump in added ocean heat content between 2025, which developed a weak La Niña at the end of the year, and 2024, which came at the end of a strong El Niño year.) While sea surface temperatures have risen since the industrial revolution, thanks to our use of fossil fuels, these measurements don’t provide a full picture of how climate change is affecting the oceans. “If the whole world was covered by a shallow ocean that was only a couple feet deep, it would warm up more or less at the same speed as the land,” says Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth and a coauthor of the study. “But because so much of that heat is going down in the deep ocean, we see generally slower warming of sea surface temperatures [than those on land].”","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:24.180230

(Savings based on 20% discount on four voice lines with eligible internet service, plus $10/month discount with eligible AutoPay & paperless bill, which starts within two bills.) Don’t need four unlimited wireless plans? Check out if your employer offers a discount—a couple of mine have in the past, and you can save $10 per month per line on the unlimited plan. Check here to see if your workplace qualifies. You can also get a discount on a new phone with an eligible trade-in, but the best deal yet may be the fact AT&T lets you try its wireless free for 30 days. Keep your current service and phone number while trying out AT&T’s network from your device—no catches or commitments. You don’t even need a credit card. It’s a great way to see if you get good service where you’ll be using the phone most. Save More With AT&T Family Plans If you want multiple people on your phone line or are adding a line for your child’s first phone, an AT&T Family Plan is one of the most cost effective ways to make the change. With AT&T family plans, you can mix and match any of AT&T’s unlimited plans to get great deals and serious discounts on any smartphone for each family member. Depending on what you choose, plans start at only $36 per month, per line (for 4 lines).

Get 77% Off Plans With Exclusive NordVPN Discount Code NordVPN is pretty much always having a sale, but some of the deals are better than others and this is one of the best we’ve seen. Right now, NordVPN is offering 77% off its regular price, plus an Amazon gift card valued up to $50 when you sign up for a 2-year Prime plan. It's valid for the first 15 months of the subscription, with threat protection, high-speed VPN, and more. Follow the link above and use our exclusive coupon code at checkout to get the deal. Save More With a NordVPN Subscription Plan The two-year Plus plan is the most popular, and our recommendation. For a limited time, their more comprehensive Prime 2-year subscriptions qualify for up to 77% off, and you’ll receive 3 free months with select 2-year plans, starting with the Plus option. NordVPN offers different plans for different needs, including one-year and one-month plans. Plans’ pricing varies greatly, with short-term, one-month plans starting at $13. The plans get cheaper the longer you commit to a plan, to reward loyal VPN customers. One-year plans start at $5 and go to $10, depending on which package you choose. Two-year plans are even cheaper, starting at $3 and going up to $7 for the top-tier plans with all of the bells and whistles. It makes a lot more sense to invest in a longer protection plan to keep your information and devices safe, for less. How Do I Buy A NordVPN Subscription Plan? If NordVPN is the right service for you, the best way is to order straight from their website because it’s the cheapest price and you’ll get all of the perks from buying directly from the brand. Once you’ve picked the best service for you, click “Continue to Payment.” After, all you need to do is input your email address, select your payment method, and if you’ve nabbed a NordVPN promo code from WIRED, input that in the box at payment and watch the price slash. Score a NordVPN Discount Code for 15% Off The coupons aren’t the only deals to be had. You can wait for a sale (see above) or if you qualify, there are discounts for students, graduates, teachers, healthcare, military, and first responders. Once verified with Student Beans, you can unlock a NordVPN promo code for 15% off plans. NordVPN Friend Referral Discount If you like NordVPN, you can save yourself even more with the refer-a-friend promotion. You’ll receive 3 months free for every friend who buys NordVPN through your referral link. The more friends you refer, the more rewards you’ll earn. Your friends will get the same deal you did, 3 extra months if they choose the 1- or 2-year plans or 1 free month if they opt for the monthly plan. Can You Get a NordVPN Free Trial? Curious about NordVPN services but don’t want to make the jump? You’re in luck. NordVPN offers a 30-day free trial. To try it out, you’ll need to pick the plan that’s right for you, and download the NordVPN app on your device. NordVPN also has a 3-day free trial on Android. And you can try NordVPN risk free for a month: you’ll need to pay for a subscription up front, but if NordVPN isn’t the right fit, you can request a refund within 30 days of your date of purchase. Get the latest NordVPN Pricing NordVPN has four tiers of plans fit for every type of need. Each gets you a secure VPN, but with each level you’ll get even more perks, like an ad tracker and blocker and 1 TB of Cloud storage. Right now, you can get up to 77% off each plan, including three months free. Check out which plan (and price) is the best fit for you here. How Can You Get NordVPN for iPhone? Lucky for you, it’s easier than ever to get NordVPN for iPhone. Having a VPN (virtual private network) on your iPhone or iPad helps to keep your internet connection secure and protects your data. All you need to do is set up a VPN app on your iOS device, then connect to a VPN server. Once you do that, it encrypts all the data your device sends and receives, making it even more secure. Simply download, sign up to create a new account or click “Log in” if you already have one, connect, and tap “Secure my connection” for instant VPN protection. What Is NordVPN Meshnet? The NordVPN Meshnet allows users to safely access their devices, no matter where they are. You’ll need to set up Meshnet, but once it’s up and running, it functions like a secure local area network (LAN) by connecting the devices directly. Meshnet ensures high speed, low latency, and advanced security for everything from file sharing, work collaboration, and multi-player gaming.","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 06:10:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:26.958053

147,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-jonathan-ross-renee-good-shooting-firearms-trainer-testimony/,"ICE Agent Who Reportedly Shot Renee Good Was a Firearms Trainer, Per Testimony","Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer identified by multiple news outlets as the federal agent who shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday, is a veteran deportation officer in ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division, according to sworn testimony from the federal district court in Minnesota obtained by WIRED. A member of a Special Response Team, ICE’s version of a SWAT team, he’s had duties as a firearms trainer and led teams drawn from multiple federal agencies including the FBI, Ross testified. The testimony stems from a December 2025 trial related to a June incident with parallels to the interaction that led to Good’s killing. In June, according to Ross’s testimony, he led a team seeking to apprehend a man named Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, who was on an administrative warrant for being in the United States without authorization. Because the man’s home was across from a school and immigration agents had no authority to enter his home, Ross testified, they instead trailed him in unmarked vehicles. Muñoz-Guatemala’s attorney did not immediately reply to a request for comment. According to the December testimony and a New York Times account of an FBI agent’s affidavit associated with the case, Ross approached Muñoz-Guatemala and asked him to roll down his window and open his door. Ross, who testified that he had been driving an unmarked vehicle, was dressed in ranger green and gray, and wore his badge on his belt, broke the driver’s side back window and reached into the vehicle, at which point Muñoz-Guatemala pulled away. While being dragged at a speed he claimed seemed like “40 miles an hour at least, if not more,” Ross pulled out his Taser and fired it at the driver. Muñoz-Guatemala continued to drive and succeeded in shaking Ross from the car. At trial, Ross testified that he suffered injuries that required 33 stitches. According to the affidavit, Muñoz-Guatemala called 911 to report that he’d been assaulted by ICE, which led to his arrest. Last month, he was convicted of assault on a federal officer with a dangerous weapon. Reports from the Minnesota Star-Tribune, The Intercept, and The Guardian identified Ross as the shooter who killed Good, a mother and recent transplant to Minneapolis, during an immigration enforcement action in the city. Video of the incident appears to show a federal agent firing shots into Good’s vehicle as she attempted to leave the scene. The officer did not appear to have been struck by the vehicle, and Good appeared to be turning the wheel to avoid contact, video analysis by The New York Times and The Washington Post shows. At Thursday’s White House press briefing, vice president JD Vance answered questions about the incident, and his responses included numerous identifying details about Ross, mainly relating to his interaction with Muñoz-Guatemala. “That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car, six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg,” said Vance, “so you think maybe he is a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?” Department of Homeland Security secretary Kirsti Noem has repeatedly described Good’s actions as an intentional act of “domestic terrorism.” An FBI investigation into Good’s killing is ongoing. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED in a statement that the department is “not going to expose the name of this officer. He acted according to his training.” McLaughlin added that federal immigration agents “are under constant threat from violent agitators” because of “doxxing” and that the Minnesota Star Tribune, which first published Ross’ name, “should delete their story immediately.”","Fri, 09 Jan 2026 03:19:26 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:28.404431
148,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/made-in-china-what-chinese-companies-showed-off-at-ces/,Why a Chinese Robot Vacuum Company Spun Off Not One but Two EV Brands,"If you’ve never been to Shenzhen, China’s electronics capital, the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas is the next best thing. I’m reporting this week from the sprawling event, surrounded by fancy, strange, and often unnecessary gadgets, and despite my sore legs, I’ve barely scratched the surface. There are at least 900 Chinese tech companies attending CES this year, almost a quarter of the total exhibitors, according to an analysis of the conference’s exhibitor directory. I even saw two Chinese humanoid robots at different booths dancing to the same viral Chinese rap song five minutes apart. But at CES, Chinese companies are showing off far more than just gadgets; also on display are artificial intelligence software, electric vehicles, self-driving technology, and more. Today, I’m sharing the four most important trends I’ve seen at CES, from the rise of Chinese smart glasses to the quiet adoption of generative AI video tools. Seeing Is Believing Meta has sold over 2 million pairs of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, but the tech giant just announced it’s delaying their global rollout. Chinese AI companies, meanwhile, are taking the product category into overdrive. At CES, there are at least three dozen Chinese AI eyewear products on display this year. One of the most promising brands in this space is Rokid, a Hangzhou-based company that has been making VR and AR glasses since 2018. AR glasses are particularly promising, because they are one of the least invasive gadgets to wear for long periods of time, says Zoro Shao, Rokid’s global general manager. Shao says the ideal pair should weigh less than 50 grams, have full-color display, need to be charged only once a day, and retail for less than $500. But Shao says smart glasses are still fairly niche, and mass adoption remains far away. “Chinese electric vehicles became unstoppable once they accounted for 5 percent of the total car market in China; now they’re almost 50 percent of the market,” Shao says. Cumulative sales of Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, in contrast, represent less than 1 percent of the US population. I tried out Rokid’s flagship glasses, which project a tiny screen in the center of your field of vision that can display GPS directions, AI chatbot conversations, language translations, and a teleprompter. For now, everything is displayed in a single color—green. I was impressed how the glasses could be adapted to my eyesight (I’m quite nearsighted, and smart goggles are usually a pain for me to try). You can insert a pair of prescription lenses into Rokid’s glasses, a process that only took a few seconds. They also have a real-time translation tool, which records the other speaker’s voice, runs it through AI models from Alibaba or Microsoft, and then presents the translation in real time on the same tiny screen. It worked surprisingly well when I tested it, but it’s still awkward to be reading text on a screen when there’s a human standing there talking directly to you. Speaking of Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant was also at CES showing off its own new smart glasses, which were released in November. But it had a tiny booth on the edge of one exhibition hall, and the only employee who had the glasses wasn't there when I arrived. Alibaba declined to tell me how well the glasses are selling, but a company representative says it plans to offer them outside of China soon. I also spoke with a Chinese company called Appotronics, which makes the tiny laser projectors that enable on-lens displays in smart glasses. The smallest model they showed me is about the size of a Lego brick, can display full color on the lenses, and is inexpensive to manufacture.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 21:25:40 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:28.851852
149,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/x-grok-app-store-nudify-csam-apple-google-content-moderation/,Why Are Grok and X Still Available in App Stores?,"Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is being used to flood X with thousands of sexualized images of adults and apparent minors wearing minimal clothing. Some of this content appears to not only violate X’s own policies, which prohibit sharing illegal content such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), but may also violate the guidelines of Apple’s App Store and the Google Play store. Apple and Google both explicitly ban apps containing CSAM, which is illegal to host and distribute in many countries. The tech giants also forbid apps that contain pornographic material or facilitate harassment. The Apple App Store says it doesn’t allow “overtly sexual or pornographic material,” as well as “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,” especially if the app is “likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group.” The Google Play store bans apps that “contain or promote content associated with sexually predatory behavior, or distribute non-consensual sexual content,” as well as programs that “contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.” Over the past two years, Apple and Google removed a number of “nudify” and AI image-generation apps after investigations by the BBC and 404 Media found they were being advertised or used to effectively turn ordinary photos into explicit images of women without their consent. But at the time of publication, both the X app and the stand-alone Grok app remain available in both app stores. Apple, Google, and X did not respond to requests for comment. Grok is operated by Musk’s multibillion-dollar artificial intelligence startup xAI, which also did not respond to questions from WIRED. In a public statement published on January 3, X said that it takes action against illegal content on its platform, including CSAM. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the company warned. Sloan Thompson, the director of training and education at EndTAB, a group that teaches organizations how to prevent the spread of nonconsensual sexual content, says it is “absolutely appropriate” for companies like Apple and Google to take action against X and Grok. The amount of nonconsensual explicit images on X generated by Grok has exploded over the past two weeks. One researcher told Bloomberg that over a 24-hour period between January 5 and 6, Grok was producing roughly 6,700 images every hour that they identified as “sexually suggestive or nudifying.” Another analyst collected more than 15,000 URLs of images that Grok created on X during a two-hour period on December 31. WIRED reviewed approximately one-third of the images, and found that many of them featured women dressed in revealing clothing. Over 2,500 were marked as no longer available within a week, while almost 500 were labeled as “age-restricted adult content.” Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the governing body of the European Union, publicly condemned the sexually explicit and nonconsensual images being generated by Grok on X as “illegal” and “appalling,” telling Reuters that such content “has no place in Europe.” On Thursday, the EU ordered X to retain all internal documents and data relating to Grok until the end of 2026, extending a prior retention directive, to ensure authorities can access materials relevant to compliance with the EU’s Digital Services Act, though a new formal investigation has yet to be announced. Regulators in other countries, including the UK, India, and Malaysia have also said they are investigating the social media platform.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:25:32 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:29.648868
150,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/maga-trump-rewriting-ice-shooting-minneapolis/,MAGA Is Already Rewriting the ICE Shooting in Minneapolis,"Trump administration officials and MAGA world are attempting to rewrite the shooting in Minneapolis. The shooting took place on Wednesday morning when several masked agents—later identified by Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin as members of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency—approached a vehicle. Video footage shared on social media appears to show a masked agent ask the driver to get out of the vehicle before grabbing the door handle. At this point, the driver appears to reverse, before driving forward and turning. Another masked federal officer, standing near the front of the vehicle, pulls out a gun and fires at the vehicle, killing Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman. The masked officer who fired at the vehicle was identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as ICE agent Jonathan Ross. McLaughlin did not immediately respond to an email asking if DHS could confirm the Star Tribune’s reporting. Almost immediately, federal government officials portrayed Good as the perpetrator. Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem called Good’s actions an act of “domestic terrorism,” adding that the victim had “weaponized her vehicle” and that the agent involved had simply “followed his training.” Later on Wednesday in a Truth Social post, president Donald Trump wrote that Good had “viciously” run over the agent while blaming the “radical left.” In a press conference on Thursday morning, Noem doubled down, once again calling Good a “domestic terrorist,” while falsely claiming the agents involved were “surrounded and assaulted and blocked in by protesters.” On Thursday, vice president JD Vance claimed Good was “a victim of left-wing ideology” and that she had “[thrown] their car in front of ICE officers,” adding, “You've got to be a little brainwashed."" The administration’s effort to immediately spin the narrative, and deflect the blame from the agents Trump has empowered to target communities across the country, is something the current administration has done repeatedly. This case, however, is arguably one of the more egregious examples thus far, given how wildly the sanctioned government narrative diverges from the reality shown in video footage of the incident shared online. MAGA world influencers very quickly fell in line. Trump’s decision to blame the “radical left” was echoed by his loudest supporters online, some of whom predicted mass violence from the left as a result of the incident. “She was trying to stage an illegal blockade of the road to interfere with ICE agents and then rammed her car into one of them when they attempted to apprehend her,” podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X, in a post viewed nearly 700,000 times. “This isn’t even a close call. Entirely justified. She is 100 percent to blame for her own death.” Video footage of the incident appears to directly contradict Walsh’s claim that Good “rammed her car” into the agent who shot her through the windshield and the driver’s window. Local politicians also disputed this claim: Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called the administration’s version of events “bullshit” and a “garbage narrative.” Frey also said ICE should “get the fuck out of Minneapolis.” Minnesota governor Tim Walz also rejected the government’s narrative, instead blaming Trump’s policies which, he said, are “designed to generate fear, headlines, and conflict … Today that recklessness cost someone their life.” That didn’t deter other influencers and content creators, however. “The Minneapolis ICE shooting can now be 100% confirmed to be self defense from this new video,” Robby Starbuck, a visiting fellow with the hugely influential Heritage Foundation, wrote on X. “The deceased anti-ICE driver clearly HIT the ICE agent that opened fire with her car. This is textbook self defense.”","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:17:12 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:30.208431

In truth, Ares has been sent by a villainous tech CEO (played by Evan Peters) to steal the “Permanence Code” created by original Tron character Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), so that digital beings can infiltrate reality permanently. While it’s full of action and impressive CGI, it glances over a lot of the real concerns around AI’s infiltration into everyday life. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour—The Final Show Over the course of 21 months—with a tour featuring 149 shows in 51 cities across five continents—an estimated 10 million people got to witness Taylor Swift’s iconic Eras Tour in person. But on December 8, 2024, only 60,000 people got to see her very last performance at Vancouver’s BC Place stadium, where Swift pulled out all the stops and even added a whole new set from that year’s The Tortured Poets Department album. Now, Swifties around the world can witness it, too, with this nearly three-and-a-half-hour rockumentary that puts you in the center of it all. Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark Indiana Jones is back! After the original four films in the swashbuckling movie series left the streamer in October when their license expired, all those boring legalities have been settled and fans can once again binge all of Harrison Ford’s archaeological adventures. We suggest kicking it off with the the movie that started it all (and for our money is still the best). Set in 1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark sees our whip-wielding hero (Ford) traveling the world and going to death-defying lengths to ensure that he recovers the storied Ark of the Covenant—a long-lost relic that has the power to make an army invincible—before fellow archaeologist René Belloq (Paul Freeman) does so on behalf of Nazi German forces. Madame Web OK, we’re not going to sugarcoat it: As far as MCU movies go, Madame Web is one of the series’ worst (it currently holds an 10 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes). It’s impossible to deny that some of the creative decisions made were very bad ones—so much so that even star Dakota Johnson has publicly voiced her disappointment in the project. But the movie has also got a handful of things going for it: namely, the always-captivating Johnson in the title role. (Plus Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, and Adam Scott.) While the execution is far from perfect, it does offer a fresh take on a superhero origin story. In this case, New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb’s (Johnson) newfound ability to see the future—and change it. Love+War At a time when the business of news is changing, and journalists are coming under fire from high-ranking political figures, Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario is a testament to the importance of a free press. For more than 20 years, Addario has been traveling the world to capture the realities of war and humanitarian crises for outlets like The New York Times and National Geographic. It’s a difficult job, and a dangerous one (she’s been kidnapped twice). But back home, Addario is a wife and mother of two who struggles daily with the sacrifices it takes to juggle the personal and the professional. In an industry dominated by men, Addario has made her mark—and this Nat Geo documentary offers a powerful look at exactly how she has accomplished it all. The Fantastic Four: First Steps Is the third time really the charm? In the case of the Fantastic Four, the answer is a resounding yes. Following two previous, and largely disastrous, attempts to bring the superhero quartet to the big screen—first when Tim Story did it in 2005, then when Josh Trank tried in 2015—Marvel seems to have figured out the formula for making their so-called “First Family” stick. The film stays true to the original comics with its period 1960s setting and finds astronauts Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn) navigating the challenges of becoming both celebrities and superheroes after cosmic ray exposure gifted them with superhuman abilities. Just as the world starts finally feeling normal again, and Reed and Sue prepare to welcome their first child, the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) descends and announces that Earth is set to be destroyed. It’s a typical comic book movie setup that is elevated by both the newness of these characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the likability of the actors playing them. A second film is already in development, but we’ll see the foursome pop up in December’s Avengers: Doomsday, too. Something Wicked This Way Comes When a traveling carnival comes to a small Midwestern town, two best friends—Will Halloway (Vidal Peterson) and Jim Nightshade (Shawn Carson)—suspect that something is not quite right. They soon discover that the carnival’s mysterious boss, Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce), has nefarious plans for the townspeople and enlist the help of Will’s dad (Jason Robards) to help them stop him. Rad Bradbury wrote the screenplay for Something Wicked This Way Comes, based on his own 1962 novel, and the film was a rare foray into dark themes for Disney at the time, but developed a rabid cult following over the years. It’s been incredibly difficult to find for decades, so its arrival on Disney+ has fans rejoicing. Thunderbolts* Though it failed to do Avengers numbers at the box office, leading many to label it a flop, ticket sales don’t always tell the full story—especially when it comes to the MCU. Florence Pugh reprises her role as Yelena Belova, a Black Widow–trained assassin who gets caught up in a sabotage plan concocted by corrupt CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When Yelena and her fellow killers-for-hire realize they’ve been duped into killing each other to clean up de Fontaine’s mess, they instead band together—with the help of Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Yelena’s dad/super soldier Red Guardian (David Harbour) to seek revenge. At this point it’s not really a spoiler to note that the asterisk in the title was meant to denote the placeholder title, as the group is rechristened the “New Avengers.” Sacramento In Sacramento, cowriter-director Michael Angarano stars as Rickey, an emotionally stunted man-child who is not ready to grow up, even as those around him have moved on to find careers, get married, and start families. Glenn (Michael Cera) is one of those old pals, who finds himself unwittingly agreeing to take a road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento so that Rickey can scatter his recently deceased dad’s ashes. What follows is the stage of male friendship that happens somewhere between Superbad and Sideways, with both men learning something about each other—and themselves—whether they want to or not. Though the film was a hit with critics when it screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, it sadly flew largely under the radar in its brief theatrical run. Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story As the original “summer blockbuster,” one might imagine that there are few behind-the-scenes stories fans have yet to hear from Steven Spielberg and Co. about the making of Jaws. But this Nat Geo documentary proves that even the movie’s most diehard fans might still have a thing or two to learn about the film that scared millions of beachgoers away from the water. In celebration of last year’s 50th anniversary of the film, this 90-minute doc features interviews with Spielberg—and many people who have been inspired by the movie over the years—to help you see it in a whole new light. Music by John Williams Speaking of the 50th anniversary of Jaws, now seems like the perfect time to show our appreciation for composer John Williams—without whom, that Steven Spielberg classic (and pretty much any Spielberg classic) would not feel the same. The second-most-nominated person in Oscar history (his 54 nominations are only bested by Walt Disney, who earned 59 nods), Williams has been producing memorable movie scores for nearly 70 years now and has quietly helped to turn movies into cinema. This original documentary gathers up some of the 93-year-old’s closest collaborators, including Spielberg and George Lucas—who swears that “Star Wars would basically not be Star Wars without Johnny Williams’ music.” It’s a touching, and perhaps long overdue, tribute to a true Hollywood titan. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse In 2018, when Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters, it changed perceptions of what Spider-Man movies, and animated films, could be. No longer led by Peter Parker, a kid from Queens who gets bit by a radioactive spider, it was fronted by Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn who met a similar fate in another part of the multiverse. Across the Spider-Verse continues Miles’ story and his quest to save the multiverse, and his timeline, from a terrible fate. Fun, heartbreaking, and a thrill to watch, it’s one of the best Spider-Man movies ever. The trilogy’s final film, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, is set to arrive in theaters on June 4, 2027. The Abyss In many ways, The Abyss is the ultimate James Cameron movie. The idea for it first came to the filmmaker as a teenager, and it features all the storytelling and visual hallmarks of Cameron’s more famous movies. In a way, it’s essentially an underwater version of Aliens: A US submarine has been ambushed and sunk to the bottom of the ocean in the Caribbean. A Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) and two petroleum engineers with a sticky romantic past (Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are sent on a rescue mission, but are racing against the clock as a storm is gathering above the water and Soviet ships attempt to the reach the sunken sub before their American counterparts arrive. As one might expect in a Cameron flick, all is not as straightforward as it seems, and the rescuers encounter what is deemed “non-terrestrial intelligence.” Though originally released in 1989, this new 4K restoration gives new life to Cameron’s underwater sci-fi classic. Elton John: Never Too Late Slowly but surely, filmmaker R. J. Cutler is becoming America's foremost chronicler of celebrity. After covering Billie Eilish, Martha Stewart, and James Belushi, the documentarian has now trained his lens on Elton John. Following the hitmaker as he prepares for his final North American show at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium in 2022, which livestreamed on Disney+, Elton John: Never Too Late jumps back and forth in time, using archival interviews and previously unseen footage to unearth a full picture of the musician's decades-long career. If nothing else, think of it as a companion piece to the 2019 biopic Rocketman. Deadpool & Wolverine The Deadpool movies have always stood out for being proudly anti–superhero movie and boldly R-rated. Even though Deadpool & Wolverine is the first film in the series that’s officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it only took several years of production delays and one massive studio acquisition to make that happen), it's just as raunchy as the installments that came before. Six years after Ryan Reynolds last graced screens as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool has hit what might be his rock bottom. When he’s given the opportunity to regain the lives and loves he lost in another timeline, he must enlist the help of an extremely disinterested Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to make it happen. Reynolds and Jackman’s onscreen chemistry is electric, making this one (foul-mouthed) team-up you don’t want to miss. Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band Bruce Springsteen came out of the Covid-19 lockdowns revved up and ready to put on one hell of a show. For Road Diary, The Boss gave director Thom Zimny an all-access pass to the creation of the tour he and and the E Street Band have been on since 2024, including archival footage and interviews with the band and Springsteen himself. Zimny has been documenting the rocker’s life on the road for more than two decades now—and won two Emmy Awards for his efforts (for 2001’s Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City and 2018’s Springsteen on Broadway)—making this documentary essential viewing for any fan. Inside Out Don’t cry. But also cry. A lot. Inside Out is the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious. Inside Out 2 Though it arrived 10 years after the release of Pixar’s Oscar-winning Inside Out, this sequel picks up just two years after the original film's ending. Riley, now 13 years old, is officially a teenager—and not quite ready to contend with the various new emotions that come with that phase. Among them: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Fortunately for all of them, not to mention Riley’s parents, Joy (Amy Poehler) is still there to help balance these emotions out. Yet again, Pixar triumphs in making a movie with a message that is also fun for the whole family. The Beach Boys “There’s definitely been ups and downs,” says singer/songwriter Mike Love in The Beach Boys. “We’ve probably been counted out half a dozen times.” Yet more than 60 years after the band’s founding, these California Dreamers have managed to defy audience expectations just as many times—and redefine what pop music can be in the process. Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny codirect this insightful documentary, which features brand-new interviews with Love, the late Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine—not to mention the many artists they have inspired (Lindsey Buckingham, Janelle Monae, Don Was, and Ryan Tedder among them). Fantastic Mr. Fox Wes Anderson assembled an all-star cast and crew for this gorgeous stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) makes a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) that he’ll stop his farm-raiding ways when she reveals that she is pregnant. Years later, the crafty canine is feeling angsty and tempted to return to his criminal pastimes when temptation comes knocking right next door. But Mrs. Fox starts to suspect something is amiss when a bounty of fresh food starts finding its way into their home. Even worse, the local farmers are none too happy about being raided by a pesky fox—and band together to do something about it. Noah Baumbach cowrote the script with Anderson, and the cast includes many of Anderson’s most frequent collaborators, including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. Jim Henson: Idea Man Watching the trailer for Jim Henson: Idea Man, it strikes you: How has there not been an exhaustive documentary about Jim Henson before now? Muppets, The Dark Crystal, Sesame Street—the puppeteer had a hand in all of them. In this documentary, Ron Howard looks at Henson's (tireless) work, his incredible impact, and the legacy he left behind. Let It Be If Peter Jackson’s recently re-edited The Beatles Anthology or three-part Get Back docuseries (which are both also on Disney+) left you wanting even more unfiltered access to the Beatles, we’ve got both good news and bad news: Let It Be is the 1970 documentary from which much of the footage seen within that series was taken. On the plus side, the original 16-mm print of the film—which has gone mostly unseen for the past 50 years—has undergone a painstaking restoration, courtesy of Jackson (yet again). While it lacks some of the emotional nuance of the series, as we see less of the sometimes-uncomfortable interactions of a band on the verge of their breaking point, it serves as a wonderful time capsule in which it was created. Feel free to pair the two together for one long binge (and throw in Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing for good measure). Summer of Soul Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson made his directorial debut with this feature documentary, which recounts the groundbreaking Harlem Cultural Festival—a six-week-long celebration of Black culture, including music, history, fashion, and beyond. The film features rarely-seen clips of performers such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly & the Family Stone. Why have you never heard of the event? Possibly because it was overshadowed by Woodstock, which took place during the same time in the summer of 1969. Ironically, when the film won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 2022 Academy Awards, it was overshadowed yet again: It’s the award that was being handed out when Will Smith infamously slapped Chris Rock on the stage. (Here’s your chance to rectify missing that acceptance speech.) Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) Were you one of the lucky ones who saw Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in person? Did you see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters? Well guess what? You can now also watch it on Disney+! Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) is kind of like the one that played at AMC cinemas, but it's also got four new acoustic songs: “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” “I Can See You,” and “Maroon.” It also features the folklore track “Cardigan.” So, whether you saw the tour, the movie theater experience—or neither—there's now yet another way to take in Taylor. Are you ready for it? X-Men Any property as beloved as X-Men is bound to have more than a few detractors when it makes the leap from page to screen. But the first X-Men movie managed to impress skeptical comic book fans and newcomers to the mutant war with its compelling storyline and stellar cast, which included Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, and then-newcomer Hugh Jackman. The film kicked off the first in an ever-growing franchise of the battle between mutants and humans, which now totals 13 films and more than $6 billion in box office receipts. With X-Men now officially part of Marvel Studios, expect to see lots more of this expanded cast of characters (beginning with the aforementioned Deadpool & Wolverine and this year’s highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday). Until then, though, go back and watch this 2000 classic, and prepare for the future. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny It may be impossible to reach the heights achieved by timeless classics like Temple of Doom or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this latest installment in the Indiana. Jones franchise puts the whip back in Harrison Ford’s hands, letting him fight Nazis and finally get (maybe) some closure to his artifact-hunting life. The movie, directed by James Mangold, also gets some fantastic humor and verve from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Helena, the daughter of an old ally of Indy’s who has perhaps less-than-pure interest in the Dial of Destiny, an ancient time-travel device that Dr. Jones, of course, thinks belongs in a museum. Spider-Man: Far From Home Far From Home, which stars Tom Holland as the Spandex-wearing superhero, is notable for being the first film in Phase Four of the MCU—and the first time we see an Avenger attempting to pick up the pieces following the events of Avengers: Endgame. For Peter Parker, that means taking a boring old class trip to Europe, which turns into anything but when Earth is attacked by a villainous group of Elementals, which Spidey can only fight with the help of the mysterious—and appropriately named—Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). Consider watching it to prep for Holland’s next web-slinging adventure, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, which officially arrives on July 31. Mrs. Doubtfire Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a lightly employed voice actor and devoted dad of three who has just been dumped by his wife and is only allowed to see his children one day per week. So he does what any rational person would do: asks his brother, who just happens to be a makeup artist, to dress him up as an older woman and applies to become a nanny working for his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field). That Miranda doesn’t realize the person she has entrusted her children with is the man she was married to for more than a decade might speak more about her character. Ignore the ridiculous setup and instead enjoy more than two hours of Robin Williams going full Robin Williams. Bon appétit! Big Teenager Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a Zoltar machine that he could grow up overnight—and comes to find his older self (Tom Hanks) staring him back in the mirror the next morning. In an effort to hide his fast-forwarded body, Baskin hides out in New York City, where he falls backward into his dream job at a toy company and meets the woman of his dreams (Elizabeth Perkins). Big is the movie that made Tom Hanks, well, Tom Hanks (it also marked his first Oscar nomination). But it’s Robert De Niro who was originally set to star; when he was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, Hanks stepped in. Finding Nemo Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a young clown fish with an imperfect fin and a dad (Albert Brooks) who worries endlessly about his son’s safety. Which is forgivable, given that Nemo’s mom—and all his siblings—were victims of a barracuda shortly before their eggs hatched. So when Nemo is captured while the duo are swimming in the Great Barrier Reef, it’s up to Marlin to find and save his only son. With an all-star cast of voice actors—led by the always-perfect Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful blue tang named Dory (who would go on to star in her own adventure)—Finding Nemo is part of the heyday of Pixar filmmaking where each film seemed to surpass the absolutely perfect one that preceded it. The Princess Bride The late Rob Reiner directed many fantastic films throughout his career, and this adventure-comedy-fairytale—written by William Goldman (the legendary screenwriter who once famously said of Hollywood that “nobody knows anything”) from his own novel—is one of his most beloved works. The ever-quotable tale tells the story of a young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who is engaged to marry a prince (Chris Sarandon) but is really in love with former farmhand Westley (Carey Elwes), who she believes was killed in a pirate attack. When Buttercup is kidnapped just days ahead of her wedding, a chain of events proceed to possibly reunite the in-love couple, or spell death for one (or both) of them. Goldman was famously critical of his own work, but didn’t mind taking credit for two of his movies. The Princess Bride was one of them (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the other). The Little Mermaid Does the live-action version of The Little Mermaid improve upon the beloved 1989 animated classic? Of course not. But Disney is on a tear when it comes to reimagining the movies you loved as a kid, and this is one of the Mouse House’s better efforts. Oscar nominee Rob Marshall (Chicago, Mary Poppins Returns, Into the Woods) is behind the camera for this tale of a young mermaid who longs to be (sing it with us) “part of your world.” Yet it’s Halle Bailey, delivering a powerhouse performance as Ariel, who truly makes The Little Mermaid worth watching. The Nightmare Before Christmas Whether you think of Henry Selick’s imaginative stop-motion adventure as a Halloween film or a Christmas movie doesn’t really matter, as there’s never a bad time to add The Nightmare Before Christmas to your watch (or watch-again) list. When the mischief-makers in Halloweentown, including pumpkin king Jack Skellington, discover the magic of Christmas, they decide to kidnap Santa Claus and claim both holidays for themselves. Even in today’s CGI-soaked world, the artistry behind The Nightmare Before Christmas remains painfully impressive—and the macabre yet kid-friendly tone makes it a fun watch for the entire family. There’s also a sing-along version if you’re in the mood. Cinderella In case you don’t know the story: After Cinderella loses her beloved mother, her father marries a nasty woman with two equally nasty daughters. While they spend their days tormenting the kind-hearted Cinderella, Prince Charming, the most eligible bachelor in all the land, only has eyes for her. Seventy-five years after its original release, Cinderella remains a Disney classic for a reason. Now it’s back with an impressive 4K restoration that has been several years in the making. The Incredible Hulk To Marvel fans, Mark Ruffalo is the only Bruce Banner. But that’s only after Eric Bana tried on the supersized superhero’s tiny purple pants in 2003’s Hulk—and then passed them on to Edward Norton for this 2008 flick, which had the misfortune of hitting theaters just one month after Iron Man. The MCU has always had a messy timeline, but audiences shouldn’t be too quick to write this movie off, particularly those looking to kick back with a solid summer popcorn flick. Norton may lack Ruffalo’s effortless charm, but he’s got the Doc Green part of the character down. Stan Lee Easily the most recognizable name in comics, Stan Lee has had an impact on the medium—and on pop culture broadly—that simply can’t be overstated. Director David Gelb’s documentary about “The Man” delves into not only his legacy, but also his history. Tracing the comics maestro’s life from his early years in New York City to his work cocreating iconic characters like Spider-Man and Black Panther to his time as everyone’s favorite Marvel movie cameo, Stan Lee is essential viewing for any fan. Spider-Man While Sam Raimi’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies predate the official MCU, the famed director really set the stage for what that future universe would look like, with its mix of solid storytelling, genuine laughs, and impressive visuals. Maguire is perfectly cast as the awkwardly charming Peter Parker, who—having just discovered his superhero powers—is learning to harness them. Venom Venom may not have been a hit with critics, but WIRED senior editor Angela Watercutter nailed exactly what the movie was when she called it “a bad movie with great cult-movie potential.” While it rivals Doctor Strange for its stacked cast of serious talent—Tom Hardy in the lead, with Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed costarring, plus Zombieland’s Reuben Fleischer as director—the end result was, well, a bit of a jumbled mess. Nonetheless, it somehow manages to be compelling, even if you just turn it on to watch Hardy mumble, eat Tater Tots, and almost literally chew scenery for 112 minutes. If you want to watch either of its two sequels, you’ll have to rent or go to Starz for 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage, while 2024’s Venom: The Last Dance is on Netflix. The Original Star Wars Trilogy Naturally, Star Wars is one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial. The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy More than 20 years after Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope (aka simply Star Wars) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend that The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and/or Revenge of the Sith (2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all the Jar Jar Binks hate is about. The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy When Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted could not be worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), then Abrams once again (The Rise of Skywalker), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them. Turning Red Mei Lee is a 13-year-old with a problem: Whenever she’s overcome with any sort of overwhelming emotion, which is just about every emotion at that age, she transforms into a giant red panda. Eventually, Mei comes to learn that it’s an inherited family trait. And while there are people who would like to exploit her supernatural powers, she slowly learns that only she has the power to control them. Think of this as a spiritual sequel to 2015’s Inside Out, which explored the complex inner workings of an 11-year-old’s constantly changing emotions. Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing Abbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’s Abbey Road. But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which arrived on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which is also streaming on Disney+ and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves. Avatar James Cameron’s Avatar was all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’s Titanic, from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, however, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible. Avatar: The Way of Water One week before Avatar hit theaters (for the first time) in late 2009, James Cameron announced his intention to turn the movie into a full-on franchise. But the director took his sweet time in following through. Avatar: The Way of Water—which checks in on blue lovebirds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), now married with children—was released in late 2022, a full 13 years after the original made its debut. But Cameron smartly bought himself some time by setting the film 16 years after the events of Avatar. And while the critical reviews were mixed, it still ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, proving yet again that Cameron has some sort of Midas touch at the box office. Avatar: Fire and Ash, which arrived in theaters last December, has already surpassed $1 billion in ticket sales. Iron Man The MCU has released nearly three dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them—Iron Man—remains one of the best. It’s almost impossible to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved. Lady and the Tramp Sure, you can watch the live-action/CGI version that Disney+ released shortly after it launched, but why bother when the 1955 original is here too? Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning, though it was recently reworded) and Lady and the Tramp remains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose between the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way. The Muppet Movie Between The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie, Jim Henson and the Muppets were everywhere in 1979. Their first big-screen outing serves as more of a prequel, as it follows Kermit the Frog’s journey from a swamp in Florida to Hollywood, where he’s headed to pursue his dreams of becoming a movie star. Along the way, we get to witness where and how he meets the fellow members of his felt-made crew, from Fozzie Bear to Miss Piggy. Hijinks ensue when a restaurateur named Doc Hopper doesn’t take too kindly to Kermit turning down his offer to serve as the official legs of his chain’s famous fried frog legs, and follows the frog in order to seek revenge. Luca Enrico Casarosa’s Luca earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature in 2022 for its sweet and soulful story about a young boy named Luca who is hiding a dark secret: He's a sea monster living in a town on the Italian Riviera that absolutely despises his kind. Ultimately, Luca is a moving coming-of-age film about friendship, family, and overcoming our own prejudices—and truly one of Pixar’s best features. Captain Marvel Marvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes. Ant-Man Who doesn’t love a heist movie? Paul Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy, literally Earth-shattering events of Age of Ultron. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis and, of course, Rudd’s legendary likability. If you want to make it a Rudd-athon, both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are streaming, too. Avengers: Endgame There's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy. Hamilton If you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton. Moana One of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on after Frozen and Frozen 2?” Moana is in fact better than Frozen. By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.) Moana 2, 2024’s less well-received sequel, is also streaming on Disney+ (as are sing-along versions for both films). Free Solo If your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography in Free Solo is also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin. Toy Story (All of Them) While it initially might have seemed as if Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995 Toy Story, each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: In Toy Story 4, the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release. The Lion King Remember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version of The Lion King? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all before Toy Story came out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the best Lion King to use CG animation. 10 Things I Hate About You Heath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken from The Taming of the Shrew, the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog, 10 Things I Hate About You is as good as comfort-food movies get. Tron & Tron: Legacy Tron and its modern sequel, Tron: Legacy, aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places. Willow Another nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy. Willow is a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare. Captain America: The Winter Soldier Winter Soldier is among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. Thor: Ragnarok The first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from the Planet Hulk storyline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events of Civil War. It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story The newer Star Wars one-off films attract strong opinions, and Rogue One is no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy. Black Panther Black Panther had a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman). Black Panther: Wakanda Forever As WIRED senior writer Jason Parham wrote in his review of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, this movie is haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor). WALL·E Released in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat, WALL·E is classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening. Up Pixar's Up can claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’s Beauty and the Beast—which is also streaming on Disney+, and most definitely worth a rewatch—was the first). The Jungle Book Whatever mood you're in, Disney+ has The Jungle Book to suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.) Guardians of the Galaxy The first volume of Guardians of the Galaxy didn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began with Iron Man in 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters. Guardians is worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' Snap.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 20:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:31.168697
152,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-bird-feeders/,"Best Bird Feeders With Cameras, Tested and Reviewed (2026)","you’ve probably seen a smart bird feeder or know someone who has one. They’re fairly recognizable from a distance with their clear housing, cameras, and solar panels, and perhaps a friend or family member has sent you a photo or video of a bright goldfinch or handsome woodpecker (guilty). The question at this point, then, is whether these things are really worth the $100-plus price tag. Are they actually durable? And what about the squirrel problem? Lucky for you, we’ve been testing the most popular smart bird feeder models, including Netvue’s original Birdfy Lite feeder ($140) and Birdbuddy's Pro ($179), for over a year—in rain, snow, and heat, and in a yard with persistent squirrels. We’ve explored the apps and notification settings, examined the photo and video quality, noted which features are hidden behind a subscription paywall, and used Cornell Lab’s All About Birds—as well as Google Lens and our own local expertise—to verify the accuracy of AI identifications. Updated January 2026: I’ve added the solar-roof version of Kiwibit's Beako as a new pick and new testing notes for both Birdbuddys, added a feeder from Detiko to Others Tested, and ensured up-to-date links and prices. Next up is the Coolfly Aura, a feeder with a unique modular camera system, which debuted at CES this week. Best Overall This cheery blue- or yellow-roofed feeder, from security company Netvue, is the first smart feeder WIRED tested, back in 2022. At that time, we gave it a 6/10 rating for its high price and wonky AI. Both metrics have improved dramatically since then—Birdfy's app is now the second-most user-friendly on the market, behind only Birdbuddy, and this feeder is often on sale for $150 or less. If you pay $20 more, you get a lifetime subscription for AI identification, which is a solid deal, especially since the AI's success rate is fairly decent. Without it, it'll cost you $5 a month, but it's not required to get plenty of enjoyment. This is the feeder I bought my elderly parents for Christmas during an Amazon Prime Day sale for its reliability, easy setup, and easy-to-navigate app, and it's still going strong two years later. The 1080p camera has one of the widest viewing angles of any smart feeder, at 155 degrees, and it offers color night vision. The IP65 plastic construction also makes this feeder durable and easier to clean, and the 50-ounce seed reservoir is super easy to fill with its convenient flip-up top. Not all bundles come with a solar panel, but you can buy it separately. Unlike other feeders, the solar panel is not built in and will have to be mounted and connected separately with the included 9.8-foot charging cable. (The Birdfy can be mounted on a pole, wall, or tree, though if you mount it on a pole using the 5-7-9 siting rule, you won't be able to mount the solar panel.) Best Upgrade Photograph: Kat Merck Kiwibit via Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Kiwibit Beako (With Solar Roof) $270 Amazon $280 $220 (21% off) Kiwibit WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Thoughtful engineering makes for easy maintenance Solar panel works great in all weather Very sturdy construction 8 MP photos and 4K HD video TIRED Pricey for a smart feeder and rarely on sale Only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Requires a subscription for all features This Beako model is not only one of the most thoughtfully designed feeders on the market, it's also what I use in my own yard when I'm not testing feeders for work. The 1.5-liter dual-hopper plastic seed reservoir is removable from the body for refilling, so you don't have to take the whole feeder down; the 8-megapixel photos and 4K HD video are much better quality than you'll find from most competitors; and the components come apart for easy cleaning. I also tested the original version with a separate solar panel, and my only complaint was that the panel stopped charging the camera after about six weeks. There’s now a version with a built-in solar roof, which has done an excellent job keeping things charged during its six-week-long test, even in cloudy weather. The IP65 plastic body is extremely thick and sturdy, and unlike lighter-weight models, it's designed to hold up in more extreme weather. The app is easy to navigate, and the whole setup is fully functional without a Kiwibit Plus subscription ($4/month or $47/year, purchasable through the Kiwibit app)—it even includes AI identification as a base feature, and it's pretty decent. However, Kiwibit Plus is necessary to access all features, mainly extended 60-day storage and the ability to record up to three minutes of video if a bird is doing something interesting, which is a unique feature among smart feeders and one I discovered I love. (Nothing more frustrating than having a video cut off right as a bird is about to do something funny.) If you’ve tried other smart feeders and found them lacking, this one costs a bit more for what it is, and it's almost never on sale, but if you know you like having a smart feeder, I think it's worth the investment. Note, however, that it only works on 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi, and the warranty is half the length you get from competitors. Best Connectivity Photograph: Kat Merck Video: Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Camojojo Hibird Pro $170 Amazon WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Runs on 2.4 5 GHz and 5 GHz 4K Ultra HD video Solar panel stays charged even in cloudy weather TIRED Heavier than most smart feeders AI is still just OK Subscription now required for all features Camojojo's original Hibird feeder has long been a reliable model in my testing stable, unique for its ability to run on both 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands—almost all smart feeders are 2.4 GHz only—and this year saw the debut of an upgraded model, the Hibird Pro. This one has built-in solar panels, an option for pole mounting, and supposedly improved AI identification, though it still frequently misidentifies even common birds in my West Coast backyard as East Coast species. The app is not as streamlined or user-friendly as Birdfy's or Birdbuddy's, but it's still easy enough to navigate, with options for changing video length (default is 10 seconds) or viewing in slo-mo. Video is the default media type it saves, though this is 4K Ultra HD. Without a subscription, you can't search past videos by bird, and cloud storage is capped at 5 GB over 60 days, though the feeder does come with a 128-GB SD card. You'll also get “smarter” chats with the app's AI Q&A function, “Dr. Bird,” and the ability to share across two devices ($45 year/$4 month). I appreciate the generous 1.5L seed hopper, though this, combined with the solar panel and battery, makes this one heavy feeder. When filled, it tips the scales at 5 pounds, so if you do pole mount, you will need to use both included hose clamps. I also wouldn't attempt to mount it on anything unstable. Other Hibird features transferred to the Pro are the assembly screws having little handles on them, so you won't need a screwdriver, and a chunky IP66 plastic body. It was subjected to a little bit of squirrel chewing during my test, but still held up well. Best Smart Hummingbird Feeder Birdbuddy is known for its user-friendliness and thoughtful and fun app, and its new Pro Smart Hummingbird Feeder is no exception. Everything about its use is intuitive and easy. AI identification, 5 MP photos, 2K HD video with slo-mo—everything you need is included out of the box. A subscription is optional to unlock features like family sharing and a higher bit rate, but the feeder is perfectly usable without it. There’s also no auxiliary solar panel to worry about, as it’s built into the roof. Pairing with your phone is a cinch, integrating it into the Birdbuddy app with other feeders is a snap, and even filling it is no problem—unlike other hummingbird feeders that have weirdly cavernous capacities and/or need to be filled upside down, the Birdbuddy’s bottom screws off and holds a reasonable 1.75 cups of liquid. This is more important than you’d think, as Cornell Lab of Ornithology points out that the easier it is to clean a hummingbird feeder, the more likely you are to do it often and well. It also comes with extra plastic flowers and a little brush to clean them with, and the app sends reminders as to when it's time to clean. You'll also find fun, seasonal touches in the app, like the ability to send digital bird holiday cards with your pics, or a tool to superimpose hats, clothes, and various accessories on the birds, which is actually funnier than it sounds. However, as with the Birdbuddy Pro seed feeder, below, the big downside is that the feeder's sensor doesn’t always pick up every bird that visits, which can definitely be a bummer when you see something interesting out the window but it doesn’t show up in the app. A Unique Smart Birdhouse Photograph: Kat Merck Photograph: Kat Merck Photograph: Kat Merck Chevron Chevron Birdfy Nest Polygon Smart Birdhouse $280 $210 (25% off) Birdfy $390 $200 (49% off) Walmart WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED User-friendly app that compiles shareable “stories” No subscription needed to use Remote control allows troubleshooting without disturbing birds Interchangeable hole sizes to attract different bird species TIRED Some connectivity issues Our test model attracted no birds Varnished interior and large cavity size may be off-putting, and audible camera click when going live could scare curious visitors Birdfy’s Polygon Smart Birdhouse isn’t the first smart birdhouse on the market, but it is the most interesting-looking. The parallelogram-esque, turquoise-paneled shape won a Gold award at 2024’s French Design Awards, and it’s easy enough to mount on a pole, fence, or tree. All the camera equipment is located in an easy-to-open rear hatch, and there’s even a remote control at the end of a 10-foot cord to be able to charge (though it has a built-in solar panel, so you likely won’t need to) or reset the 1080p camera. It's simple to integrate with the easy-to-use Birdfy app, which is ready and waiting to assemble a bird's shareable “story,” from assembly of the nest to hatching to fledgling, and finally “the end,” when the nest is abandoned for the season. Note that the camera does emit an audible click whenever it's triggered by movement or the app, and the inside is a little larger than most birds would naturally gravitate to, though I did like that it comes with interchangeable hole sizes to interest different species. We did have a few assorted connectivity issues, and our test house didn't attract any visitors this year, but a project director for Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s NestWatch said it should only be a matter of time.

In addition to having a visibly larger and more advanced lens, the camera's now got a larger focus range, 122-degree field of view, and high-fidelity microphone. (A subscription to Birdbuddy Premium for $70 a year unlocks 2K Ultra with a higher video bit rate, allowing for richer colors, sharper images, and less background noise—plus the ability to set alerts for sick or injured birds, among other things—but it's perfectly usable without this. ) The photos aren't nearly as impressive as those by competitors like the Birdfy Pro Duo, Camojojo Hibird, or Kiwibit Beako, and the camera, frustratingly, only captures a handful of the birds that visit. (The non-solar version is occasionally flagged as a frequently returned item on Amazon due to both this and charging issues, so I recommend the solar version.) However, Birdbuddy's app is a consistent standout, with a user-friendly design and plenty of helpful alerts, like if a cat is detected nearby, or if it's time to clean the feeder. It also serves you insights gathered over time, like what time certain species seem to prefer to visit. (Finches apparently like to visit my yard at 10 am daily.) The Birdbuddy also “sleeps” at night and does not seem to emphasize capturing photos of people, so it wouldn't make a good choice to double as a security camera, and there are also unique seasonal features like the ability to send holiday cards or “dress up” visiting birds with hats, glasses, and sweaters. (It is funnier than it sounds, really!) Both Birdbuddys work with 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi only. Another Birdbuddy downside is the infuriatingly small, hinged opening for filling the 4 cups' worth of seed. The feeder comes with its own spouted cup, but I have yet to fill the feeder without making an enormous mess. I also tested the 3-in-1 Nutrition Set ($39), which includes a screw-on tray that can variably become a water fountain, jelly dish, or fruit stake for fruit-loving species like orioles. I've used it as a jelly dish and water fountain and found that it blocks enough of the perch area that birds tend to shift out of camera view to avoid it. However, this feeder is still worth it for those who like a more streamlined app experience and/or want to take advantage of some of its unique sharing features, especially Premium's ability to share your feeder livestream with others.

It's compatible with both 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands—a rarity for bird feeder cameras—and the cute green owl face streams the same 4K HD video and 1080p pics as the bigger Hibird feeder, above. There is a subscription tier with features like increased storage, but the camera is still usable without it. There's an auxiliary solar panel included for charging, and you can mount it via its ¼-inch nut on the included bendable arm and bracket, or jury-rig a custom solution. It pairs seamlessly with the Hibird app, with access to AI (which is just OK), livestreaming, and the Dr. Bird ChatGPT-like feature, where you can ask bird-related questions. (The answers are corny and not as granular as they could be, but it still could be useful for some.)

Not only is it suspiciously called “Birdty,"" it's not intuitive to navigate and requires a subscription to access all features—including AI identification, which is terrible. I have also seen this feeder body (TT Nature offers it in green or red) sold from time to time under other Amazon insignias, so it's not unique to this brand. However, those usually have solar panels attached to the roofs, from which squirrels can hang upside down to avoid tripping the spring-loaded perch. This one leaves off the panel (there is one that can be mounted separately, but it's not possible when the feeder is pole-mounted, which is what I recommend), but it doesn't need it, as the charge from the 5,200-mAh battery lasts well over a month. I had my test unit sited on a pole with a baffle far from fences and overhanging branches, and though an occasional squirrel would still manage to find the feeder, the spring-loaded perch mechanism worked as intended—a squirrel tries to sit, and a bar flips up to block access to the seed. (There's also a squirrel alarm feature that can be toggled on and off in the app, but in my experience, those never work.) I have seen squirrels try to chew through the sides, but given that the body is metal, their efforts are fruitless.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:33:19 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:32.184766
153,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-deal-126/,These Bose Noise-Canceling Earbuds Are $50 Off,"Yesterday I wrote about a deal for $50 off the Apple AirPods Pro 3, but if you're not an iPhone or MacOS user, they won't do you much good. That's why today I've got a deal for you on the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 Earbuds, an excellent pair of earbuds that are direct competition to the AirPods Pro 3. They're also marked down by $50 to just $250 in the Desert Gold color scheme, with lesser discounts for the Midnight Violet version. Bose has always been known for its active noise canceling, and these earbuds improve on that formula with better noise reduction and a wider sonic range. While they have the same drivers as their predecessor, Bose has made some improvements to the processing and tuning to make them sound better. If you want to tweak the experience further, there's a full EQ in the app, as well as more customization settings for touch controls and immersive spatial audio. The buds actually use the welcome chirp from donning the earbuds to adjust the sound profile to the shape of your ears, which is truly advanced tech for the category. They also got some feature improvements over the original QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, like proper wireless charging built into the case for easier top-ups. They'll run for six hours on a single charge, with up to 24 total including the charging case. That's with ANC on, which you'll likely use often given how good both the sound isolating and pass-through modes aware. Our reviewer Parker Hall specifically called out the Aware mode, which is like pass-through but with some smoothing for the loudest real-world sounds. While the QuietComfort Ultra 2 Earbuds come in a variety of colors, I only spotted the Desert Gold at the lowest $250 price point at both Amazon and Best Buy. The other discounted color, Midnight Violet, has a lesser discount that brings the price down to $269 at Amazon or $255 at Best Buy. If you're looking for something a little less extravagant, make sure to swing by our full guide to the best wireless earbuds that we've spent time with for more options.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:00:11 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:32.714553
154,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/openai-amazon-operating-system-ai-apps-ads/,AI Devices Are Coming. Will Your Favorite Apps Be Along for the Ride?,"Silicon Valley giants like Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI are racing to develop “operating systems” for AI-powered devices—and 2026 is likely the year these efforts will start to take off. The devices are largely built around a future where AI agents can take actions on a user’s behalf, without requiring them to visit an app or website. In theory, this sounds like an idyllic relationship between humans and technology. But it could rewrite the business model for a huge swath of consumer tech companies. Instead of tapping through apps filled with ads and upsells, AI devices promise that a user will be able to ask for an outcome, and get it. An AI assistant will—in theory—book your travel, order you lunch, or restock your paper towels. It should be able to figure out which service has what you need and which can offer it quickly and cheaply. Leaving aside the nontrivial problem that AI agents today can be fairly unreliable, AI-powered operating systems also threaten to separate companies from their users. That could be a nightmare for app developers. Companies like Uber and DoorDash have historically relied on keeping consumers in their apps, where they can serve ads, upsell other services, and build loyalty to keep users coming back. AI agents may strip many of these businesses down to their core services, and reduce the need for users to visit the apps at all. So even if a user pays the same price for a DoorDash delivery made through a pair of AI glasses, the company could still miss out on opportunities to sell them additional services down the road. Anjney Midha, an investor and board member at Sesame—the AI device startup cofounded by former Oculus leaders including Brendan Iribe—says that if companies don’t have “deep control over the supply of their product,” it is going to be very hard for them to operate in a world where they have to reach users through an AI agent. Historically, a key part of building a successful operating system has been creating a thriving developer platform. Companies have to give developers a good reason to build apps for their platforms. But the relationship has not been without tension. While Apple has historically given developers a way to reach lots of users, it’s also taken up to a 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases. Some tech companies are reluctant to let AI agents from smaller startups stand between them and their users. Rabbit, the startup behind the buzzy R1 device that debuted at CES 2024 (and received negative reviews), already hit this wall. CEO Jesse Lyu told WIRED that major app developers like Uber weren’t exactly eager to cooperate with the company early on, declining to grant the startup API access that would have let the R1 hail rides directly. As a result, Rabbit built workarounds to let its R1 devices tap apps like Uber without formal access. “You have to understand why they’re not super happy: They sell fucking advertisements. That’s where many of them make money,” he said, speaking of the larger tech industry. “They decided we were too small, and it wasn’t worth it for them to work with us.” Perplexity has run into this issue as well with early versions of its shopping agent. In November, Amazon sued Perplexity over an agent it offered that could purchase items on behalf of users. Amazon, which is investing in its own shopping agents, demanded Perplexity stop scraping its site, making it nearly impossible for the startup’s agent to buy products on Amazon. But other marketplaces and app developers appear willing to work with larger platforms. Companies like DoorDash, Instacart, and Expedia have signed up to build early forms of AI apps within ChatGPT, while Ticketmaster, Uber, and OpenTable debuted as early agentic features for Alexa+. The partnerships show that many tech companies are cautiously optimistic about the potential for novel app experiences that are intermediated by AI tools.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:33.208278
155,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/,How to Protest Safely in the Age of Surveillance,"Just days into 2026, fresh anger against the Trump administration has already taken hold. On Wednesday, January 7, a federal immigration officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good as she attempted to drive away from the scene of an immigration enforcement action in a Minneapolis, Minnesota, neighborhood. Despite Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem's claims that the officer “acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him” from being run over, video of the incident clearly appears to show that neither the officer nor his colleagues were in danger of being hit by Good's vehicle. Protests condemning the shooting—and the Trump administration's brutish immigration agenda more broadly—sparked almost immediately after news of Good's killing surfaced. By Thursday, the unrest had only intensified and spread to towns and cities around the United States. If you're going to join any protests, as is your right under the First Amendment, you need to think beyond your physical well-being to your digital security, too. The same surveillance apparatus that’s enabling the Trump administration’s raids of undocumented people and targeting of left-leaning activists will no doubt be out in full force on the streets. Two key elements of digital surveillance should be top of mind for protestors. One is the data that authorities could potentially obtain from your phone if you are detained, arrested, or they confiscate your device. The other is surveillance of all the identifying and revealing information that you produce when you attend a protest, which can include wireless interception of text messages and more, and tracking tools like license plate scanners and face recognition. You should be mindful of both. After all, even before Good's killing, police had already demonstrated their willingness to arrest and attack entirely peaceful protesters as well as journalists observing demonstrations. In that light, you should assume that any digital evidence that you were at or near a protest could be used against you. “The Trump administration is weaponizing essentially every lever of government to shut down, suppress, and curtail criticism of the administration and of the US government generally, and there have never been more surveillance toys available to law enforcement and to US government agencies,” says Evan Greer, the deputy director of the activist organization Fight for the Future, who also wrote a helpful X (then-Twitter) thread laying out digital security advice during the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. “That said, there are a number of very simple, concrete things that you can do that make it exponentially more difficult for someone to intercept your communications, for a bad actor to ascertain your real-time location, or for the government to gain access to your private information.” This story was originally published on May 31, 2020 and updated on January 8, 2026. Your Phone The most important decision to make before leaving home for a protest is whether to bring your phone—or what phone to bring. A smartphone broadcasts all sorts of identifying information; law enforcement can force your mobile carrier to cough up data about what cell towers your phone connects to and when. Police in the US have also been documented using so-called stingray devices, or IMSI catchers, that impersonate cell towers and trick all the phones in a certain area into connecting to them. This can give cops the individual mobile subscriber identity number of everyone at a protest at a given time, undermining the anonymity of entire crowds en masse. “The device in your pocket is definitely going to give off information that could be used to identify you,” says Harlo Holmes, director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a nonprofit press advocacy group. (Disclosure: WIRED’s global editorial director, Katie Drummond, serves on Freedom of the Press Foundation’s board.)","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:34:04 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:33.792576

The agent was later identified by Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin as an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer. The shooting occurred on Wednesday morning, and social media footage of the scene shows two masked federal agents approaching an SUV parked in the middle of the road in a suburb south of downtown Minneapolis. One of the officers appears to ask the driver to get out of the vehicle before grabbing the door handle. At this point, the driver appears to reverse, before driving forward and turning. A third masked federal officer, standing near the front of the vehicle, pulls out a gun and fires at the vehicle, killing Good. The videos of the incident shared on social media in the moments after the shooting did not include any footage of any of the masked ICE agents with their masks off. However, multiple images showing an unmasked agent began circulating on the internet within hours of the shooting. The images appear to be screenshots taken from the actual video footage, but altered with artificial intelligence tools to create the officer’s face. WIRED reviewed multiple AI-altered images of the unmasked agent shared on every mainstream social media platform, including X, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, BlueSky, and TikTok. “We need his name,” Claude Taylor, the founder of anti-Trump Mad Dog PAC, wrote in a post on X featuring an AI-altered image of the agent. The post has been viewed over 1.2 million times. Taylor did not respond to a request for comment. On Threads, an account called “Influencer_Queeen” posted an AI-altered image of the agent and wrote: “Let's get his address. But only focus on HIM. Not his kids.” The post has been liked almost 3,500 times. ""AI-powered enhancement has a tendency to hallucinate facial details leading to an enhanced image that may be visually clear, but that may also be devoid of reality with respect to biometric identification,"" Hany Farid, a UC-Berkeley professor who has in the past studied AI's ability to enhance facial images, tells WIRED. ""In this situation where half of the face is obscured, AI, or any other technique, is not, in my opinion, able to accurately reconstruct the facial identity."" Some of the people posting the images also claimed, without evidence, to have identified the agent, sharing the names of real people and, in a number of cases, providing links to the social media accounts of these people. WIRED has confirmed that two of the names circulating don’t appear to be immediately connected to anyone associated with ICE. While many of the posts sharing these AI images have limited engagement, some have gained significant traction. One of the names shared online without evidence is Steve Grove, the CEO and publisher of the Minnesota Star Tribune, who previously worked in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s administration. “We are currently monitoring a coordinated online disinformation campaign incorrectly identifying the ICE agent involved in yesterday’s shooting,” Chris Iles, vice president of communications at the Star Tribune, tells WIRED. “To be clear, the ICE agent has no known affiliation with the Minnesota Star Tribune and is certainly not our publisher and CEO Steve Grove.” This is not the first time AI has caused issues in the wake of a shooting. A similar situation emerged in September when Charlie Kirk was killed and an AI-altered image of the shooter, based on grainy video footage released by law enforcement, was shared widely online. The AI image looked nothing like the man who was ultimately captured and charged with Kirk’s murder.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 16:33:56 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:34.271816
157,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-inbox-gmail/,Google Is Adding an ‘AI Inbox’ to Gmail That Summarizes Emails,"Google is putting even more generative AI tools into Gmail as part of its goal to further personalize user inboxes and streamline searches. On Thursday, the company announced a new “AI Inbox” tab, currently in a beta testing phase, that reads every message in a user’s Gmail and suggests a list of to-dos and key topics, based on what it summarizes. In Google’s example of what this AI Inbox could look like in Gmail, the new tab takes context from a user’s messages and suggests they reschedule their dentist appointment, reply to a request from their child’s sports coach, and pay an upcoming fee before the deadline. Also under the AI Inbox tab is a list of important topics worth browsing, nestled beneath the action items at the top. Each suggested to-do and topic links back to the original email for more context and for verification. Courtesy of Google Despite the continued spread of generative AI features, the underlying reliability of these tools remains iffy. Back in 2023, when Google’s chatbot was still called “Bard,” I tested the company’s nascent Gmail extension that tried to summarize my messages and search through the inbox for insights. At the time, this extension was a complete bust, with a bevy of incorrect responses. Since then, Google has worked to better its base AI model, called Gemini, and integrate those improvements into its suite of existing software services, including Gmail as well as Search. Despite the company's advances in AI, current Gmail users are still shown a disclaimer stating that Gemini “can make mistakes” when attempting to search an inbox and answer questions. Courtesy of Google For users who are concerned about their privacy, the information Google gleans by skimming through inboxes will not be used to improve the company's foundational AI models. “We didn’t just bolt AI onto Gmail,” says Blake Barnes, who leads the project for Google. “We built a secure privacy architecture, specifically for this moment.” He emphasizes that users can turn off Gmail’s new AI tools if they don’t want them. At the same time Google announced its AI Inbox, the company made free for all Gmail users multiple Gemini features that were previously available only to paying subscribers. This includes the Help Me Write tool, which generates emails from a user prompt, as well as AI Overviews for email threads, which essentially posts a TL;DR summary at the top of long message threads. Courtesy of Google Subscribers to Google's Ultra and Pro plans, which start at $20 a month, get two additional new features in their Gmail inbox. First, an AI proofreading tool that suggests more polished grammar and sentence structures. And second, an AI Overviews tool that can search your whole inbox and create relevant summaries on a topic, rather than just summarizing a single email thread.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:34.801645
158,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-be-taking-creatine-supplements/,Creatine Supplements Are Everywhere. Do I Need Them? (2026),"Creatine monohydrate is typically sold as a flavorless, white powder that you can mix into water or a shake. According to Amati, the standard dose is 3 to 5 grams per day. Some athletes may “load” with higher doses, but studies show that this offers no long-term benefits and can put unnecessary stress on the kidneys. Muscle Growth and Exercise Performance Creatine is most useful for activities that demand short, intense effort: sprinting, weightlifting, and high-intensity interval training, to name a few. It’s far less relevant for endurance sports like marathons. Some evidence suggests creatine also increases muscle glycogen storage, which could help with recovery and energy replenishment between sessions. Creatine doesn’t directly build muscle, but paired with resistance training and adequate nutrition, it can help preserve muscle strength and lean body mass. It’s particularly important if you’re recovering from an injury, or as you age, when sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) becomes a risk, as it activates specialized stem cells known as satellite cells. Zimmerman points out that women, especially in perimenopause and menopause, may see health benefits. “As women get older—starting in our forties—we lose body mass 1 to 2 percent a year, and that can affect bone health later on in life,” says Zimmermann. “Creatine [supplements] support keeping and building lean muscle mass.” Zimmermann adds, “Women tend to have lower muscle mass than men, just naturally, so I think women may actually respond better to supplementation, because they’re at baseline.” Creatine and Brain Health While the effects of creatine supplementation on athletic performance are well documented, its effects on mental performance are still emerging. Early findings are promising. Studies suggest it may reduce mental fatigue, especially during high-stress situations, such as sleep deprivation or exhaustive exercise. It may also improve certain aspects of memory, particularly in groups with lower baseline creatine levels, such as vegetarians and older adults. Some preliminary research even suggests it could help with symptoms of depression by supporting brain energy and boosting the production of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. That’s particularly relevant for women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, says Zimmerman. “Estrogen shifts affect brain health, our mood, brain fog, and being able to think clearly.” Is Creatine Safe? For most healthy adults, creatine is a safe and well-tolerated supplement for months or even years of use. Short-term and long-term clinical trials have found no significant health risks. The main side effects are minor: weight gain from temporary water retention in the first week of supplementation, bloating, and mild gastric discomfort, usually from oversize doses. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: People with kidney disease should avoid creatine unless cleared by a health care professional. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against creatine use in people under 18 due to limited research on its long-term effects in children and young adults. due to limited research on its long-term effects in children and young adults. The Food and Drug Adminstration doesn’t regulate dietary supplements for label accuracy or purity. Choose a reputable brand with third-party testing to ensure you’re getting a product that is what it says it is. Also, skip the creatine gummies. Our Favorite Creatine Supplements Best Overall Thorne offers a colorless, odorless, and, most importantly, flavorless powder that dissolves into protein shakes, smoothies, or just water. While it does offer flavors like strawberry and pineapple-orange, I always choose an unflavored version when available, so that I'm not consuming unnecessary additives. Each small scoop delivers a solid 5 grams of creatine. Thorne also sells stick-pack single servings for on-the-go convenience. Thorne is one of the wellness brands I trust the most because its dietary supplements all undergo four rounds of testing. First, they screen raw materials for contaminants. During the manufacturing process, they check the supplement bottles and labels for defects. They test the finished products for purity and potency, ensuring no microbiological contamination has occurred. Lastly, they perform stability testing to confirm its label claims through the expiration date. Best Value This creatine powder is tasteless and odorless, and it comes with a nice 5-gram scoop that allows you to easily measure how much you've put in your drink. It's easy to store, gives you about 100 5-gram servings, and comes in a nondescript bottle that won't make you feel like you're some fitness influencer. I have enjoyed it in coffee, tea, and just plain water, though I'd recommend sticking to only 5 grams per drink; it can get a bit chalky if you try to do more in 8 ounces of water. —Parker Hall Best Flavors Sticking to a daily regimen of any kind is difficult for me, but this creatine is truly so delicious that I look forward to drinking it every day. I tried the pink lemonade flavor, which is tart and sweet. There are other fruity flavors available, like Peach and Strawberry Açai, as well as an unflavored version. Each serving contains 5 grams of creatine, plus a gram each of collagen and BCAAs. I don’t particularly care about the collagen, since the science around it is minimal, but BCAAs can help build muscle as well as ease muscle soreness. While Peach Perfect is marketed towards building your booty, creatine can help build muscle everywhere. I definitely noticed a difference while lifting weights during the week when I ran out of this powder (before I set up a subscription on Amazon). The supplement dissolves quickly and has a pleasant, non-gritty texture. I’ve even mixed it in my daily dose of greens. The supplement undergoes third-party testing via Eurofins to check for pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants. —Louryn Strampe Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

159,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/rgb-led-televisions-2026/,2026 Is the Year of the RGB LED TV,"For how excellent they've come to look, today's televisions come with a brain-numbing assortment of acronyms for shoppers to parse. It's like the scariest dinner party I've ever attended. Remember LED, QLED, mini LED, micro LED, OLED, QD OLED? Meet RGB LED! Sadly, all these acronyms do actually mean something, and this year's popular newcomer—RGB LED—implies shockingly accurate colors. Hiding behind upcoming panels from Hisense, Sony, Samsung, and LG announced at CES 2026, RGB LED (unhelpfully also called micro RGB or RGB mini LED) is the hot panel technology to talk about this year. I just wish they'd call it “Supercolor,” or something folks could actually remember. What Is RGB LED? Courtesy of Samsung Modern TVs compete on the qualities of their backlighting and their color representation. Edge-lit LED TVs of the past were thin, but their darkest tones tended toward the gray instead of the truly black. This has been fixed in recent years by various technologies. Quantum dots help colors appear better on the latest LED TVs (often called QLED). Tech like multi-zone LED (and more recently mini-LED) backlighting uses thousands of tiny white LEDs to illuminate specific sections of the screen from behind. OLED (“organic LED”) TVs, introduced by LG a little over a decade ago, do something similar but more accurately, with each pixel acting as its own backlight. New RGB LEDs TVs bring color to the previously shade-based backlighting world of LED TVs, with the illumination arrays behind the screen gaining the ability to backlight the panel in front of them with red, green, or blue. This means gorgeous color accuracy, along with a theoretical overall brightness that can outcompete OLED TVs. A historic criticism of OLEDs has been that they just aren't bright enough for well-lit rooms, and that the individual pixels can burn into the display with prolonged exposure to the same content. Frankly, our TV reviews team has seen those issues largely evaporate over the past few generations of OLED panels (and recent Quantum Dot OLEDs), all with truly eye-burning brightness. What RGB LEDs do promise is scarily accurate colors in addition to said extreme brightness. They have been able to display 100 percent of the BT.2020 color scale, which is something prior-generation LED TVs were simply not capable of. This means that, for folks watching the (admittedly) limited amount of content, typically animated, that uses this expanded color palette—shout out to contributor Caleb Denison of CalebRated for his recommendation of Inside Out 2 as a test disc—you should be able to see shades that were previously impossible to see. Early Arrivals Photograph: Ryan Waniata This is the first meaningful generation of RGB LED TVs that will be available to consumers, with the aforementioned top players in the space all having announced some version of RGB LED screen or another for release in 2026.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 12:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:35.916789
160,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/solving-the-pc-memory-crisis/,The Daring Attempt to End the Memory Shortage Crisis,"A supply shortage is the last thing tech companies want to talk about at CES. The annual trade show is their chance to promote new products and drum up excitement for what's coming, not discuss the one thing that could make selling new products in 2026 an uphill battle. But I've read the reports. I've seen the RAM kits selling for thousands of dollars. I've heard the statements from laptop suppliers and part manufacturers warning investors about what's coming. You probably have too. The memory chip shortage is already dire for companies and for individuals who build their own PCs. But don't think because you only use a laptop and a phone you're going to get out of this so easy. While the situation remains grim, I met two companies who have engineered ways out. Their plans aren’t guaranteed to work, and they won’t be easy to pull off. But they just might be our only hope. Waiting for the Bubble to Pop Dell COO Jeff Clarke. Photograph: Luke Larsen “We're waiting for the AI bubble to pop,” a spokesperson from a small PC manufacturer who wished to remain anonymous told me when asked about how they were handling the memory shortage. None of the big laptop manufacturers or PC builders would say something quite that direct, but actions speak louder than words. While happily selling “AI PCs,” Lenovo, Dell, Asus, and HP have all stated that they'll be doing everything in their power to secure their supply of DRAM for the foreseeable future. “I’ve been at this a long time. This is the worst shortage I’ve ever seen.” Dell COO Jeff Clarke DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is the kind of memory used in laptops and phones, and it’s what the three main memory manufacturers are now turning their backs on in favor of high-bandwidth memory for AI data centers. Lack of memory is the main reason you can’t run ChatGPT on your PC and have to outsource every prompt to the cloud. I spoke to Dell COO Jeff Clarke in December about what his company was doing to remedy the situation. “Our focus has been to secure the supply. That has always been the number one rule of our supply chain—to never run out of parts. We’ve been at this for a while. This just didn’t show up. So we’ve been out there for a while securing our supply.” It’s a sentiment similar to what competitors like HP and Asus have told shareholders. But hoarding memory will only have two effects: It will raise prices even more or further tighten supply. Rumors of higher prices on electronics have begun to flood the internet. On the last day of 2025, Asus went first, officially announcing that it would be raising prices and tweaking configuration options on existing products. This was the follow-up to a leaked internal document from Dell stating that prices could rise by as much as 30 percent in 2026.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:36.454677
161,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/true-patriots-are-cashing-in-on-the-apocalypse/,True Patriots Are Cashing In on the Apocalypse,"Today, the US government advises every citizen to build a disaster kit and concoct plans for an array of cataclysms. According to a 2023 survey from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 51 percent of Americans are in some way “prepared for a disaster.” This helps explain why the prepping industry’s market cap is forecast to be nearly $300 billion by the end of the decade. Two of the firms competing for market share have nearly identical names and offer the same basic slate of products: power generators, dehydrated food, and water filtration. There’s Stapleton’s employer, 4Patriots, and its rival, My Patriot Supply. While exact revenue figures are difficult to pin down, officials at My Patriot Supply tell me that, before the pandemic, they rented part of a 45,000-square-foot space; today, the company built and fully utilizes a 428,000-square-foot warehouse not far from Stapleton’s home. These two firms are aggressively jockeying to be the industry’s true patriot prepping company, with one official from My Patriot Supply claiming that 4Patriots is their “archnemesis.” My Patriot Supply is particularly bellicose, deeming the other company and its competitors “fake patriots”in a video. Meanwhile, both firms have notched their share of consumer complaints with government and business watchdogs over the years. 4Patriots customers have alleged that the company produces faulty water filters, defective generators, and dubious food. One person said their order was rife with roaches, while another claimed the company's Aztec Chili with Mango made them “can’t leave the bathroom sick” for a week. (According to the Better Business Bureau website, someone associated with 4Patriots replied to this alleged complaint a day later, adding, ""I'm so sorry that you had many issues after consuming the survival food kits.”) In 2016, the company voluntarily recalled a couple thousand generators due to an unforeseen fire hazard, and consumer complaints allege their generators continue to suffer from potentially dangerous electrical defects. (After putting 4Patriots’ 1,800-watt solar generator through lab testing, Consumer Reports rated it 46 out of 100.) Certainly, recalls and bad reviews are part and parcel of many businesses today, though an explicit part of the pitch from 4Patriots and its competitors is the rock-hard reliability of their goods when disaster strikes. In a comment to WIRED, a 4Patriots official said the company shipped over 5 million products to consumers over the past three years and that it places “product quality and customer safety above all else.” He declined to detail the company’s return or refund rates, asserting that to equate those numbers with “product failure or customer dissatisfaction would be inaccurate.”","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:36.987175

It has also solved more complex things like detecting atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea. While all of these biometrics are useful, the continuous tracking of blood sugar in a way that’s noninvasive (meaning it doesn’t involve needles) has eluded the makers of fitness tracking devices. Diabetics need to monitor their blood sugar constantly to make sure it doesn’t go too high and damage their organs. This is especially hard for elderly people and small children, since monitoring blood sugar usually requires a pinprick blood test or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which also reaches under the skin. CGMs have also become hugely popular among non-diabetics as the popularity of GLP-1s has skyrocketed. Eating like a diabetic—lots of protein and fiber, minimal sugar and carbs—is a great way to lose weight. Apple, among other companies, has spent years, and millions of dollars, trying to introduce a no-prick blood glucose monitor to the Apple Watch, but the feature hasn’t arrived yet. All this is to explain why I could scarcely believe that the PreEvnt Isaac was real when I saw it here at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. The Isaac is a small device, about the size of a quarter. Instead of tracking blood glucose optically through the skin, it measures volatile organic compounds in your breath to detect biomarkers like acetone that can be correlated with rising blood glucose levels. You might not be able to wear it in a smart ring or watch, but a small device that you can wear around your neck or keep in your bag without having to retreat to the bathroom to prick your skin is a huge step up in quality of life for many, many people. Upcoming FDA Authorization Photograph: Adrienne So The Isaac is named after the inventor’s grandson, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 2 years old. A 2-year-old doesn’t want to get pricked constantly. Bud Wilcox realized that “acetone breath”—that sweet, fruity breath that is a common diabetic symptom—could be used to check for blood sugar events. PreEvnt and Wilcox showcased the concept at CES 2025 (it didn’t seem real then, either). Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials at Indiana University. The study is comparing Isaac’s performance with monitoring blood sugar levels as compared to traditional blood sugar monitoring, starting with adolescents with type 1 diabetes and then expanding to adults with type 2 diabetes. The trials are being conducted with an eye toward regulatory review by the US Food and Drug Administration in the upcoming year.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:37.532971
163,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/is-craigslist-the-last-real-place-on-the-internet/,Is Craigslist the Last Real Place on the Internet?,"The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing internet pornography, from a Craigslist ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company. “There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.” Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee’s Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest internet. “The real freaks come out on Craigslist,” says Koester. “There's a purity to it.” Even still, the site is a little tamer than it used to be: Craigslist shut down its “casual encounters” ads and took its personals section offline in 2018, after Congress passed legislation that would’ve put the company on the hook for listings from potential sex traffickers. The “missed connections” section, however, remains active. The site is what Jessa Lingel, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has called the “ungentrified” internet. If that’s the case, then online gentrification has only accelerated in recent years, thanks in part to the proliferation of AI. Even Wikipedia and Reddit, visually basic sites created in the early aughts and with an emphasis similar to Craigslist’s on fostering communities, have both incorporated their own versions of AI tools. Some might argue that Craigslist, by contrast, is outdated; an article published in this magazine more than 15 years ago called it “underdeveloped” and “unpredictable.” But to the site’s most devoted adherents, that’s precisely its appeal. “ I think Craigslist is having a revival,” says Kat Toledo, an actor and comedian who regularly uses the site to hire cohosts for her LA-based stand-up show, Besitos. “When something is structured so simply and really does serve the community, and it doesn't ask for much? That’s what survives.” Toledo started using Craigslist in the 2000s and never stopped. Over the years, she has turned to the site to find romance, housing, and even her current job as an assistant to a forensic psychologist. She’s worked there full-time for nearly two years, defying Craigslist’s reputation as a supplier of potentially sketchy one-off gigs. The stigma of the website, sometimes synonymous with scammers and, in more than one instance, murderers, can be hard to shake. “If I'm not doing a good job,” Toledo says she jokes to her employer, “just remember you found me on Craigslist.”","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 10:00:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:38.066813

It even won out against competitors for Olympics and exclusive Paralympics coverage last summer. With original favorites like The Office, Poker Face, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and popular films like Oppenheimer and Jaws (as the film hits its 50th anniversary), there’s something for everyone in the family on Peacock TV. Check out our Peacock coupons, along with other great ways to save while streaming your faves. Save up to $80 With Today’s Peacock Promo Codes and Subscription Deals As someone with approximately 792 subscriptions, it can be hard to know just how much I’m paying for each (not to mention how much total I’m spending a month) and which exactly has the content I want to watch most. Peacock also knows that most people use several streaming services and that it’s important to choose the ones that fit best with your budget and needs. Coming in clutch when you're still in “stay-inside-and-keep-warm” mode, Peacock is offering one full year of Peacock streaming for only $80. One of the best ways to save on Peacock streaming is through annual plan discounts (versus monthly). That comes out to be $80 annually, meaning you’ll get 12 months for the price of 10, and save 16% on a Premium yearly plan, for only $9 per month—otherwise it’s $11 when paid monthly. There’s also Premium Plus, which has no ads, the ability to download and watch certain titles while offline, and includes your local NBC channel live, 24/7. This subscription tier is $17 per month, or $14 when paid annually. In short, you’ll be paying only $80 annually for either Basic or Premium plans! Student, Military Members, and Teachers Get $7 Off Peacock To unlock more discounts on a Peacock subscription, check if you qualify for their exclusive offers dedicated to students, teachers, and military members, medical workers, and other first responders.

Peacock also has discounts for military members and teachers – verify your status, and get 12 months of Peacock Premium for $4 per month. Save up to 40% With Peacock Apple TV+ and Xfinity Bundle Deals If it feels like you’re paying for approximately 403 streaming services, Peacock has reduced that number by one, at least. Now, you can bundle Xfinity and Peacock and save 40% on all of your favorite media content for $15 per month.

Prices vary based on which you choose: Netflix with ads is $8 per month, Peacock Premium with ads is $8 per month, and the Peacock Apple TV+ bundle is $15 per month.

Watch Your Favorites and New Peacock TV Releases This Month There is a wide breadth of new content coming to Peacock this month, including the cult favorite Peacock original adaptation of the classic original, Bel-Air, for Season 4. If you’re looking for something a little less intense, a new season of Vanderpump Rules is coming your way; so get prepared for Rich People Drama! One of the best things to do during the holiday season is to put on a nostalgic movie that is good for the whole family, like the Harry Potter series. On Peacock, you can binge the entire Harry Potter saga in the background while dozing off and sneaking into the kitchen for seconds (or thirds). If you’re like me and love to just absolutely turn your brain off (I’m talking no neuron flare ups would be detected in an MRI) and watch reality TV, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of Love Island. If you love watching Instagram models go from room to room to pool to gym and back again in a long-form version of a game of Telephone, this is the show for you. The great part is that every episode is about an hour long and there are approximately 4,200 episodes per season.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:44:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:39.008587
167,,,,,,,wired,https://www.wired.com/story/hellofresh-coupon/,Best HelloFresh Coupons and Promo Codes for January 2026,"Leveraging meal kit coupons is the extreme couponing of our times—a capitalism hack-a-thon right up there with trial yoga classes and attempting to cancel your Adobe subscription. Meal kits like HelloFresh have always been a better deal than they get credit for, even at full price: It’s actually hard to recreate meal kit meals for less than you can get the recipes delivered to your home. But it’s especially worth it when you can find a HelloFresh coupon, promo code, or discount at more than half off. I’ll admit I wasn’t that sold on HelloFresh when I first tried it most of a decade ago. It was useful, it got me out of my staid routines, but I wasn’t impressed with the selection. It felt a little basic. But lately? Honestly, it’s kinda cosmopolitan these days, after expanding to a dozen countries and absorbing the supply networks from multiple other meal plans. When I last tested the HelloFresh meal kit (7/10, WIRED Recommends), I was surprised to find myself cooking credible home renditions of ramen, ponzu-plum beef stir fry, and Southwest-accented pork roasts. And when I’m able to pick up a HelloFresh discount code, it’s generally less than I’d spend on groceries anyway. So it’s a good moment to try out a lifestyle where the food comes in the mail. Don’t Miss Out: Free Zwilling Four Star Chef’s Knife With HelloFresh I don't know if a good knife is hard to find. But they usually cost at least a hundred dollars, so it's worth noting when HelloFresh is offering one of WIRED's favorite chef's knives for free! For a limited time, you can get 50% off your first box and you’ll get a free Zwilling chef’s knife included in your third box. We thought this deal was so good, I even wrote a whole article on it, which you can check out here to get the full scoop on all the deets. Get 50% Off and up to 10 Free Meals as a New HelloFresh Customer Right now, new and returning customers can take advantage of a HelloFresh discount code offering 50% off your first meal kit box plus a free item each week. Enter your email as part of the signup process, and you’ll be auto-subscribed to an email with even more offers for both new and existing customers. Plus, new customers can get up to 55% off and extra free breakfasts, desserts, and other items with other secret discounts. HelloFresh Student and Discount: 55% Off, Free Shipping, Plus Extra 15% Off Education Discounts Available via UNiDAYS HelloFresh meal kits are pretty amenable to dorm life when ordering the ready-to-eat meals—or just saving time during grad school instead of ordering pizza, by letting the Internet do your shopping and meal planning. But student budgets tend to be tight, of course. And so there are steeply discounted HelloFresh coupon codes specifically for students. Follow the link here for a HelloFresh education promo code offering 55% off your first box, free shipping, and a continuing discount of 15% off for the first year. Discounts also apply to teachers who’ve never tried HelloFresh. Educators and school employees can get up to 12 free meals spread out across 3 boxes, plus free shipping. Click here for the HelloFresh promo code, or go here for more information about educator discounts. Note that the student and educator discounts don’t combine with any other HelloFresh discounts or promotions. Special Hero Discount for Military, Veterans, and Healthcare Workers Military discounts are a long tradition in America. HelloFresh also offers hero discount programs for first responders, health professionals, and military personnel. Heroes also get excellent discounts that include 55% off the first order, free shipping, and 15% off for the first year of HelloFresh delivery boxes. This program is open to nurses, hospital employees, EMTs, active military, veterans, and first responders. First responders include law enforcement, 911 dispatch, and firefighters. Click here to see if you’re eligible, or follow this link for more information about HelloFresh hero discounts. Note that the hero discounts don’t combine with any other HelloFresh promo codes. Give $40, Get $10 With the HelloFresh Referral Program Already a HelloFresh subscriber? You’re still eligible for discounts if you pass along subscription information to your friends. Here’s how: Send your friends a $40 discount for their own affordable meal kits. Once they sign up using your HelloFresh referral code, you’ll also get a $10 credit on your next delivery. These discounts stack. So if you sign up multiple friends with your referral code, you get multiple $10 discounts. Check out the HelloFresh meal kit referral program here. Take Advantage of HelloFresh Come Back Offers Some of these discounts are only available to new HelloFresh customers. But there’s a hack to getting discounts anyway. After you pause or cancel your subscription, check your inbox after the next few days or weeks. Often, you’ll get HelloFresh coupon codes for discounts. Typical HelloFresh “come-back” offers after a canceled subscription include: $100 to $180 off (spread out over several meal boxes), free shipping on the first box (after re-subscribing), free items such as dessert, breakfast, or an extra protein per meal, or a free meal box is offered after a break. Typical retention offers, for when customers try to cancel, include: 40% off the next box, if you decide not to cancel, or 25% off the next two meal kits. None of this is failsafe, of course, offers vary for each customer. But as with magazine subscriptions, sometimes canceling, or trying to cancel, will lead to a good discount offer from a company eager to keep your business. When to Save the Most on HelloFresh Subscriptions HelloFresh almost always has some sort of deal going, whether to bring in new customers with an especially choice HelloFresh coupon, or bring back previous customers with HelloFresh discount codes and retention offers. But summer tends to be one of the times they offer the steepest discounts, including 10 free meals across several boxes, complimentary appetizers, free ready-made items, or free shipping on select boxes. The other big times for HelloFresh coupon codes are around Black Friday and the end of the year. HelloFresh often launches limited-edition holiday meal boxes and themed meal kits, not to mention discounts for returning customers looking to cook more at home as part of New Year's resolutions.","Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:30:00 +0000",2026-01-10 20:45:40.016760
